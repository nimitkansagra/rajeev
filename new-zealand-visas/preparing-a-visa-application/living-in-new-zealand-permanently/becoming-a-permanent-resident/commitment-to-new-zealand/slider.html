                    Your commitment to New Zealand — permanent residence

                <p class="intro">When you apply for permanent residence, you must show us you are committed to living in New Zealand permanently. Find out what evidence to provide.</p>
                <h2>Showing your commitment</h2>
<p>There are 5 ways you can show us your commitment to living in New Zealand permanently.  We need to see evidence of at least one of them.</p>
<h3>Acceptable evidence of your commitment to living in New Zealand</h3>
<h4>1. You have spent enough time in New Zealand</h4>
<p>You need to have spent at least 184 days in New Zealand on a resident visa in each of the 2 years immediately before you apply for permanent residence.</p>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_note">
<div class="inz_note_title">Note</div>
<p>This 2 year period is the time immediately before you apply for permanent residence, not the 2 years since your resident visa was issued.  </p>
</div>
<p>The 184 days does not need to be in a row — you can leave and return to New Zealand as many times as your visa conditions allow.</p>
<h5>Evidence</h5>
<p>We will already have this evidence in our records of your travel.</p>
<h4>2. You have New Zealand tax residence status</h4>
<p>You are a tax resident in New Zealand if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have been in New Zealand as a resident for 41 days or more in each of the two 12-month portions of the 2 years before you apply for permanent residence, and</li>
<li>are assessed as having tax residence status for the 2 years before you apply for permanent residence.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Evidence</h5>
<p>Either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a statement from Inland Revenue</li>
<li>a completed Confirmation of Tax Resident Status endorsed by Inland Revenue.</li>
</ul>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_note">
<div class="inz_note_title">Note</div>
<p>If you have tax residence in another country, even if it’s one that New Zealand has a <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#double-tax-agreement" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Double tax agreement" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;People who are tax residents in New Zealand and another country can be&amp;#160;taxed on the same income by&amp;#160;both countries.
