                <h2>What your sponsor must do</h2>
<p>Your sponsor must provide information to us that shows they meet the sponsorship criteria. They can do this either online or using a paper form, depending on what type of visa you are applying for.</p>

<h2>Applying for a Visitor Visa or AEWV online</h2>
<p>You and your sponsor must follow this process if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are applying for a Visitor Visa online, and your sponsor will be financially supporting you during your stay, or</li>
<li>you are applying for an Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV), and your sponsor will be paying for your maternity costs.</li>

<div class="inz_accordion_section"><h3 tabindex="0">I need someone to sponsor my visa application</h3>
<div class="inz_accordion_collapsible"><div class="inz_accordion_section_content"><p>If you need someone to sponsor your visa application, you will be asked in the ‘Supporting documents’ page of your application to enter your sponsor’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>full name</li>
<li>email address</li>
<li>sharing ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you can submit your application, you need to contact your sponsor directly and ask for this information.</p>
<p>To find their sharing ID, your sponsor needs to log in to Immigration Online using a RealMe account. If they do not have a RealMe account, they need to create one.</p>
