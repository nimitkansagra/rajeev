                <h2>Who can sponsor a visa applicant</h2>
<p>Some people and organisations can sponsor your application, depending on the visa you apply for.</p>
<p>A sponsor can be :</p>
<ul>
<li>a New Zealand citizen</li>
<li>a New Zealand resident, if their resident visa has no <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#section-49-conditions" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Section 49 conditions" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes visas are subject to extra conditions under section 49(1) of the &lt;em&gt;Immigration Act 2009&lt;/em&gt;. We call these section 49 conditions. For example, if you&amp;#8217;re granted residence under the Skilled Migrant Category a section 49 condition could be that you take up an offer of skilled employment within&amp;#160;3 months of&amp;#160;arriving in&amp;#160;New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">section 49 conditions</a></li>
<li>a refugee, if they are sponsoring a family member to come to New Zealand</li>
<li>an organisation registered in New Zealand as a company, incorporated society or charitable trust</li>
<li>a government agency – for example a tertiary education provider or a school's board of trustees</li>
<li>a community organisation – but only if the visa applicant is a refugee.</li>
</ul>

<div class="inz_note_title">Note</div>
<p>Having a sponsor does not guarantee we will approve your visa. You still have to meet all the other requirements of the visa you apply for.</p>
</div>
<h2>Who cannot sponsor a visa applicant</h2>
<p>People or organisations cannot be a sponsor if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>get any financial reward or fee for sponsoring you</li>
<li>have ever been convicted of an offence under immigration law – this includes the directors, trustees or management of an organisation</li>
<li>have an outstanding debt to the New Zealand Government or other third parties as a result of sponsoring other visas</li>
<li>failed to meet sponsorship obligations in the past.</li>
</ul>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_note">
<div class="inz_note_title">Note</div>
<p>The profit your employer expects to make from your work does not exclude them from being an acceptable sponsor. </p>
</div>

<p>Your sponsor must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be a New Zealand citizen, or</li>
<li>a New Zealand resident.

</ul>
<h3>Individuals sponsoring a student visa application</h3>
