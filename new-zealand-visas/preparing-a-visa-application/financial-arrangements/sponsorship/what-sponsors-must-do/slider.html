                    What sponsors must do while a visa holder is in New Zealand
                    
                </h1>
                <p class="intro">If you sponsor a visa holder, you are responsible for them while they are in New Zealand on that visa.</p>
                <h2>Support you must provide</h2>
<p>While a visa holder you sponsor is in New Zealand you must make sure they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>the things necessary for their health and welfare, like food, clothing and healthcare</li>
<li>somewhere suitable to stay — you can provide this yourself or pay for their accommodation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also pay the cost of their return travel to their home country, if they do not intend to pay for it themselves.</p>
<p>If they are to be <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#deported" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Deported" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;A person is deported from New Zealand if the person leaves New Zealand (whether or not at the expense of the Government of New Zealand):&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;on or after the date on which a deportation order may be served on the person under section 175 of the Immigration Act 2009; or&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;after a deportation order has been served on the person; or&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;while he or she is subject to a prohibition on entry to New Zealand under sections 179 or 180 of the Immigration Act 2009; or&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the person is served with a deportation order when he or she is outside New Zealand; or&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the person was deported from New Zealand under the Immigration Act 1987.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;" target="_blank">deported</a>, you must also pay any costs associated with their deportation, such as the costs of finding and detaining them, and then sending them home.</p>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_alert">
<div class="inz_note_title">Alert</div>
<p>Even if the person you sponsor has agreed to pay for some or all their expenses, you are still legally responsible for those expenses</p>

<h3>Sponsoring a visa applicant's family members</h3>
<p>You can also sponsor the partner and dependent children of someone you are sponsoring. If you do this, you must cover the same costs for them.</p>

<h3>If the person you sponsor travels in and out of NZ</h3>
<p>If the person you sponsor has a visa with <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#multiple-entry-travel-conditions" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Multiple entry travel conditions" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/financial-arrangements/sponsorship/what-sponsors-must-do/"./about-us/site-information/glossary#resident-visa-travel-conditions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Travel conditions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;that allow a visa holder to enter and exit New Zealand multiple times while their visa is valid, however the holder must not exceed any maximum stay conditions on their visa (if applicable).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Visa holders with multiple entry travel conditions&amp;#160;still need to apply for entry permission each time they return to New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">multiple entry travel conditions</a> you are responsible for them only when they are in New Zealand on that visa.</p>
<h3>When your sponsorship begins and ends</h3>
<p>Your responsibilities as a sponsor begin from the date the person you sponsor arrives in New Zealand. If they are already in New Zealand, your sponsorship begins on the date their visa is granted.</p>
<p>Your sponsorship responsibilities end on the date the person you are sponsoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>leaves New Zealand, or</li>
<li>gets a new visa — with or without a sponsor.</li>
</ul>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_alert">
<div class="inz_note_title">Alert</div>
<p>You cannot withdraw your sponsorship. It continues even if the person you sponsor stays in New Zealand without a valid visa.</p>
</div>
<h2>If you do not meet your obligations</h2>
<p>The person you sponsor can be <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#deported" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Deported" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;A person is deported from New Zealand if the person leaves New Zealand (whether or not at the expense of the Government of New Zealand):&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;on or after the date on which a deportation order may be served on the person under section 175 of the Immigration Act 2009; or&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;after a deportation order has been served on the person; or&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;while he or she is subject to a prohibition on entry to New Zealand under sections 179 or 180 of the Immigration Act 2009; or&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the person is served with a deportation order when he or she is outside New Zealand; or&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the person was deported from New Zealand under the Immigration Act 1987.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;" target="_blank">deported</a> if you do not support them as you have agreed to do.</p>
<p>If you have not paid the costs you are responsible for, and they are paid by a third party or the New Zealand Government, that amount becomes your debt.</p>
<p>If you do not pay, we can take you to court to recover the debt even if the person you are sponsoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>is no longer in New Zealand</li>
<li>is in New Zealand without a valid visa, or</li>
<li>has a new visa.</li>
</ul>
