                <p class="intro">When you transfer your investment funds to New Zealand for the Active Investor Plus Visa, you must do so in a legal and transparent way.</p>
                <h2>What you need to do to transfer investment funds</h2>
<p>If we approve your application in principle for the Active Investor Plus Visa, you have 6 months from that date to transfer and invest your nominated funds in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The funds you transfer must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>the funds you named in your visa application</li>
<li>funds you received from selling the assets named in your application.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must transfer all of your nominated funds to holding investments in New Zealand. Your nominated funds must stay in New Zealand until you have invested NZD $15 million or the weighted equivalent into acceptable investments.</p>
<p><a href="./new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/financial-arrangements/investing-and-investment-funds/acceptable-investments-active-investor-plus" class="link__internal"><span class="link__title">Acceptable investments: Active investor plus</span></a></p>
<h3>Funds already invested in New Zealand</h3>
<p>You can use funds already invested in New Zealand to support your visa application. You must nominate them when you apply for your visa.</p>
<p>You must provide evidence of where the funds came from and how they were transferred and invested in New Zealand.</p>
<h2>Transfer methods</h2>
<p>Funds must be transferred through the banking system, a foreign exchange company or a money transfer business. The funds can come from your personal bank account, or from one of the following third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>a solicitor trust account (where the solicitor is acting on your behalf)</li>
<li>a pension scheme in your name, or</li>
<li>an investment portfolio account in your name.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must provide evidence that your nominated funds have been invested in acceptable investments and holding investments.</p>
<p>This evidence must include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The full name of the principal applicant</li>
<li>The amount invested in New Zealand dollars</li>
<li>The date the investment was made</li>
<li>The type of investment, including the name the company or bond issuer if applicable as well as the amount of shares or bonds</li>
<li>Documentary evidence of the investment</li>
<li>A letter from an external and reputable professional such as a solicitor, chartered accountant or investment broker confirming that the funds have been invested</li>
<li>A letter of confirmation from NZTE if the investment is a direct investment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nominating additional funds</h3>
<p>You can nominate additional funds if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have received an approval in principle letter,</li>
<li>the funds nominated in your application have been transferred to New Zealand,</li>
<li>you provide evidence that the funds have lost value in NZ dollar terms through currency exchange or due to unforeseen circumstances, and</li>
<li>you provide evidence of the additional funds and/or assets within the first 6 months after receiving your approval in principle letter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>If you borrow funds</h3>
<p>You may be able to transfer and invest funds from the sale of nominated assets you have borrowed if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is not economically viable or practical to liquidate the assets you named in your visa application, and</li>
<li>you borrow funds from an acceptable bank or commercial lending institution and secure them against the nominated assets you named in your visa application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Taking more time to transfer funds</h3>
<p>If you think it will take longer than 6 months to transfer your funds, you need to apply for an extension.</p>
<p>You must provide evidence that you have tried to transfer the approved nominated funds to New Zealand. This can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a letter providing the reasons why you have not transferred the funds to New Zealand yet,</li>
<li>evidence of partial fund transfers to New Zealand, for example telegraphic transfers and bank credit advice, or</li>
<li>evidence you are trying to sell your assets, for example, if you are trying to sell a property you could provide advertisements or contracts with a real estate agency.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Foreign exchange companies</h2>
<p>You can use a foreign exchange company to transfer your funds to New Zealand if the:</p>
<ul>
<li>foreign exchange company uses the banking system to transfer the funds</li>
<li>investment funds named in your visa application were transferred to the foreign exchange company directly from one or more bank accounts in your name</li>
<li>transfer is legal, both in New Zealand and the country the funds were transferred from</li>
<li>transfer can be traced — it cannot come from cash deposits</li>
<li>foreign exchange company operates lawfully — you cannot use a company that is suspected of, or proven to have committed fraudulent activity or financial impropriety to transfer your funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must provide evidence of all the steps you took to transfer your funds. We cannot accept your application if we cannot identify your funds’ physical transfer any at point.</p>
