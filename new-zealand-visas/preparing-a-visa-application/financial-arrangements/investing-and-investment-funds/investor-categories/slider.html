<div class="inz_accordion_section"><h3 tabindex="0">New Zealand companies owned by overseas companies</h3>
<div class="inz_accordion_collapsible"><div class="inz_accordion_section_content"><p>A New Zealand company that is wholly owned by an overseas company may be an acceptable investment.</p>

</div></div></div><div class="inz_accordion_section"><h3 tabindex="0">Residential property</h3>
<div class="inz_accordion_collapsible"><div class="inz_accordion_section_content"><p>We consider a residential property development to be an acceptable investment if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is a new development, and not a renovation or extension to an existing residential property</li>
<li>the development has the necessary approvals and consents</li>
<li>the purpose of the development is to make a commercial return on the open market — it must not be for you, your family or friends to live in.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must provide us with:</p>
<ul>

<p>Purchasing an existing residential property for rental purposes is not an acceptable investment.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="inz_accordion_section"><h3 tabindex="0">Commercial property</h3>
<div class="inz_accordion_collapsible"><div class="inz_accordion_section_content"><p>Commercial property is an acceptable investment if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the property is not residential or for domestic use</li>
<li>the property is used for business purposes, in that it is</li>
<ul>
<li>capable of a commercial return, and</li>
<li>not held for future use with no specific plans for development</li>
</ul>
<li>the purpose of the commercial property investments is to make a commercial return on the open market</li>
<li>neither you, your family, relatives, nor anyone associated with you lives in the development.</li>
</ul>

<div class="inz_accordion_collapsible"><div class="inz_accordion_section_content"><p>Philanthropic investments can make up 15% of your acceptable investments.</p>

<ul>
<li>a registered charity with Inland Revenue donee status and at least 2 years of annual returns, or</li>
<li>a not-for-profit organisation approved by the INZ Business Migration Visa Operations Manager, which provides social, cultural or economic benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence that a philanthropic investment is genuine may include:</p>

<div class="inz_accordion_collapsible"><div class="inz_accordion_section_content"><p>Growth investments are acceptable investments, except for:</p>
<ul>
<li>bonds, and</li>
<li>philanthropic investments.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purpose of growth investments, convertible notes are considered to be bonds.</p>
<h4>Managed funds and growth investments</h4>
<p>For managed funds, we consider what types of investments the fund manages to determine the proportion of growth investment.</p>
<p>For example, a fund that places half of its funds into bonds and the other half into shares would be recognised as having a 50% investment in growth-orientated funds.</p>
<h4>Claiming points for growth investments</h4>
<p>When you apply you must say if you wish to claim points for growth investments. This makes you eligible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>priority processing for both Investor 1 and Investor 2 visas</li>
<li>reductions in investment amount and time.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not indicate this in your application, you may not get these benefits.</p>
<h4>Investor 1 Resident Visa applicants</h4>
<p>If you invest a minimum of NZD $2.5 million in growth investments you must spend 88 days in New Zealand over the 3-year investment period.</p>
<h4>Investor 2 Resident Visa applicants</h4>
<p>If you invest a minimum of NZD $750,000 in growth investments you must spend a minimum of 438 days in New Zealand over 4 years from when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>first arrived in New Zealand as a resident, or</li>
<li>were granted a resident visa while in New Zealand.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also qualify for 20 bonus points.</p>

<p>You must make sure that any financial advice you receive is from a financial adviser who is authorised by the Financial Markets Authority of New Zealand.</p>
