                <p class="intro">If you are pregnant and apply for a temporary visa to visit, study or work in NZ you must tell us how you will pay for your maternity care while you are here.</p>
                <h2>Covering the cost of your maternity care</h2>
<p>Depending on the visa you are applying for and your nationality you may be eligible for publicly funded health care during and after your pregnancy.</p>
<p>If you are not eligible you must cover the costs of your own maternity care — when you apply for your visa, you need to provide evidence of how you will pay.</p>
<p>Maternity care includes looking after you:</p>
<ul>
<li>before your baby is born</li>
<li>during labour and birth, and</li>
<li>after your baby is born.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who can get publicly funded maternity care</h2>
<p>Some women can get maternity care no matter what visa they have for New Zealand. You are eligible if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have a partner who is eligible for publicly funded health care</li>
<li>are claiming refugee or protection status</li>
<li>are a victim of people trafficking</li>
<li>have an Interim Visa and you were eligible for publicly funded health care immediately before we issued your Interim Visa</li>
<li>are a citizen of the United Kingdom — although the range of health services New Zealand offers is limited.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Paying for your maternity care</h2>
<p>If you are not eligible for public health care and have a temporary visa to visit, study or work in New Zealand, you must show you have a minimum of NZD $9,000 to pay for your maternity care. You can:</p>
