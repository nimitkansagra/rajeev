                    Funds Transfer Scheme (FTS)
                    
                </h1>
                <p class="intro">The FTS is a secure way for students from some countries to transfer funds to support themselves in New Zealand.</p>
                <h2>Participating countries</h2>
<p>The FTS is only available to students from:</p>
<ul>
<li>China</li>
<li>India</li>
<li>Philippines</li>
<li>Sri Lanka.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The purpose of FTS</h2>
<p>The ANZ Bank of New Zealand (ANZ) operates the FTS. The FTS:</p>
<ul>
<li>shows Immigration New Zealand (INZ) you have genuine access to money to support yourself while studying in New Zealand, and</li>
<li>helps you transfer funds securely to New Zealand and withdraw a set amount each month to use in New Zealand.</li>
</ul>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_note">
<div class="inz_note_title">Note</div>
<p>Signing up to the FTS does not guarantee that we will approve your student visa application.</p>
</div>
<h2>Who needs an FTS account</h2>
<p>Use the FTS if we ask you to set one up to show you have genuine access to funds.</p>
<h2>Conditions of the FTS</h2>
<p>You can only use FTS if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you transfer at least the minimum funds you need for your first year of study</li>
<li>you agree to withdraw only a specified amount of money each month.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Minimum amounts you can transfer</h3>
<p>This is the minimum amount you need to transfer to your FTS account.</p>
<h4>Applications on or before 31 July 2022</h4>
<p>You need to transfer at least NZD $15,000 to pay your living costs for each year of study.</p>
<h4>Applications after 31 July 2022</h4>
<p>You need to transfer at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>NZD $20,000 each year, or</li>
<li>NZD $17,000 each year if you are studying in compulsory education — this is education in New Zealand for children aged 6 to 16 years.</li>
</ul>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_note">
<div class="inz_note_title">Note</div>
<p>Living costs do not include your course or tuition fees.</p>
</div>
<h2>If we ask you to set up an FTS account</h2>
<p>If you meet the criteria for a student visa we may give you a letter offering you approval in principle (AIP) on the condition you use the FTS to transfer funds to New Zealand.</p>
<div class="inz_process_timeline inz_process_timeline_h3">
<div class="inz_process_timeline_step"><h3>Apply for an FTS account and transfer your funds</h3>
<p>If you receive an AIP letter with the condition you use FTS, you must apply for an FTS account and transfer your funds.</p>
<p>Complete the FTS online application form. As the account holder, you must complete the application form yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinestore.anz.co.nz/get/funds-transfer-scheme-accounts/eligibility" target="_blank" class="link__external"><span class="link__title">Funds Transfer Scheme Online Application – ANZ</span></a></p>
<p>You need to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>your AIP letter</li>
<li>a copy of your passport.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="inz_process_timeline_step"><h3>ANZ confirms they have received your funds</h3>
<p>After your funds have been transferred to your FTS account, ANZ:</p>
<ul>
<li>sends you an email confirming they have received the money</li>
<li>contacts INZ directly to confirm the funds transfer.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="inz_process_timeline_step"><h3>INZ finalises your visa application</h3>
<p>INZ only finalises your visa application and grant your visa after we receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>the confirmation from ANZ they received your funds, and</li>
<li>the receipt for your tuition fees.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<h2>Withdrawing money from your FTS account</h2>
<p>When you arrive in New Zealand, you need to visit an ANZ branch to activate your account.</p>
<p>Once your account is active, you can withdraw money at ANZ branches or ATMs, or by using your EFTPOS or debit card.</p>
<h3>How much you can withdraw</h3>
<p>You can only withdraw a set amount each month — this will be the same amount for 12 months. The more you put in your FTS account, the more money you can withdraw each month for your living costs.</p>
<table><caption style="font-size: 1.4em;">Table 1: Example amounts of how much you can withdraw</caption>

<h3>Withdrawing all your money from your FTS account</h3>
<p>You can only withdraw the set amount released to your FTS account each month. If you want to withdraw all the money in your account, you can only do that in some circumstances.</p>
<h4>If your visa application is declined</h4>
<p>If your application is declined, contact ANZ to arrange the refund of your FTS money. You need to give ANZ a copy of our letter declining your application.</p>
<h4>If you stop your study</h4>
<ol>
<li>Your education provider tells us you are no longer studying with them.</li>
<li>You contact the ANZ bank to organise the transfer of the money in your account.</li>
<li>The bank tells us you have closed your account.</li>
</ol>
<h4>If you have completed your study</h4>
<p>If you have completed your studies and you still have money left in your FTS account, you can withdraw the remaining balance.</p>
<p>Contact ANZ and provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>evidence that you have completed your course, or</li>
<li>your new visa.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other bank accounts</h2>
<p>As well as your FTS account, you can open other bank accounts with any bank in New Zealand including ANZ.</p>
