                <p class="intro">If you are applying for a visa based on your partnership, find out how we define partnership and what evidence you can provide to show your relationship is genuine.</p>
                <h2>How we define partnership</h2>
<p>We define partnership as 2 people, who live together in a <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#genuine-and-stable-relationship" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Genuine and stable partnership" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;A partnership is genuine if it has been entered into on a long-term and exclusive basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A partnership is stable if it is likely to continue for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">genuine and stable relationship</a> in any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a legal marriage</li>
<li>a <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#civil-union" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Civil union" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;A civil union has the same property and civil rights as a marriage. It may be between couples of the same sex or couples of different sexes.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">civil union</a></li>
<li>a <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#de-facto" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="De facto relationship" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;A de facto relationship is between two people who usually live together as a couple, like a marriage or civil union. They are not married or in a civil union with each other.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">de facto relationship</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Providing evidence of your partnership</h2>
<p>You must be able to show us that you and your partner are living together in a <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#genuine-and-stable-relationship" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Genuine and stable partnership" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;A partnership is genuine if it has been entered into on a long-term and exclusive basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A partnership is stable if it is likely to continue for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">genuine and stable relationship</a> before we can approve a visa application based on your partnership.</p>
<h3>Living together</h3>
<p>Living together means sharing the same home as your partner.</p>
<p>This does not include:</p>
<ul>
<li>spending time in each other’s homes while you each maintain your own home</li>
<li>sharing accommodation while on holiday</li>
<li>living as flatmates in the same house.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence showing you are living together can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>joint ownership of, or home loan for, residential property</li>
<li>a joint rental agreement or rental receipts</li>
<li>joint utility accounts, like power or phone bills</li>
<li>joint or individual mail sent to your shared address.</li>
</ul>
<p>For some partnership applications (such as a Partner of a New Zealander Resident Visa), evidence of living together must cover a period of 12 months. Make sure you check the category you're applying under to see if we need this from you.</p>
<p>You can provide us with items showing your shared address, dated every few months, to cover the full duration.</p>
<p>These items can be addressed to you both jointly — or individually — as long as we can see that you have both been at the same address for the same period of time.</p>
<h3>Having a genuine and stable relationship</h3>
<p>Evidence of having a genuine and stable relationship needs to show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>others recognise your relationship</li>
<li>you make decisions and plans together</li>
<li>you spend leisure time together</li>
<li>you parent together, if you have children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>marriage or civil union certificates</li>
<li>birth certificates for any children you share</li>
<li>joint bank accounts being used frequently</li>
<li>joint ownership of any assets</li>
<li>joint credit cards or hire purchase agreements of things such as home appliances</li>
<li>any mutually agreed financial arrangements</li>
<li>cards, letters or emails sent to you and your partner</li>
<li>chat records and communication between you and your partner</li>
<li>social media posts or photos of you together</li>
<li>letters of support that recognise your partnership.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to supply this evidence</h3>
<p>The way we want to receive this evidence depends on how you are applying.</p>
<h4>Applying by paper</h4>
<p>If you apply by paper for a residence visa, we must receive originals or certified copies. You can send electronically issued documents as we regard those as originals.</p>
<h4>Applying online</h4>
<p>If you apply online, we accept scanned images — so you do not need to send us originals or certified copies.</p>
<h2>Minimum requirements</h2>
<p>You and your supporting partner must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be aged 18 or older, or have the consent of your parents or guardians if you are aged 16 or 17</li>
<li>have met each other before applying for a visa based on your partnership</li>
<li>not be <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#close-relatives" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Close relatives" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;Close relatives are people who are prohibited from:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;marrying each other under the Marriage Act 1995, or&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;entering into a&amp;#160;civil union with each other under the Civil Union Act 2004.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;link__external&quot; href=https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/support-family/how-family-is-defined/partnership/"https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0092/latest/DLM292639.html" target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link__title&quot;&gt;Marriage Act 1995&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;link__external&quot; href=https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/support-family/how-family-is-defined/partnership/"https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2004/0102/latest/DLM323488.html" target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link__title&quot;&gt;Civil Union Act 2004&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">close relatives</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Supporting partners</h3>
<p>When you apply for a visa based on your partnership with a New Zealand visa holder or New Zealand citizen, we call that person your supporting partner.</p>
<p><a href="./new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/character-and-identity/good-character/supporting-partner-character" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link__internal"><span class="link__title">Good character for supporting partners</span></a></p>

<h2>How we assess partnership</h2>
<p>When we assess your visa application, we consider things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>how long you have been together</li>
<li>how committed you are to a life together</li>
<li>any children you have together, including your arrangements for their care</li>
<li>whether other people recognise your relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also look at your living and financial arrangements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>how long you have been living together as a couple</li>
<li>your living arrangements</li>
<li>whether you share common household tasks</li>
<li>whether you support each other financially</li>
<li>how you share financial responsibilities</li>
<li>whether you own property together or share your property.</li>
</ul>
<h3>If you have not always lived together</h3>
<p>If you and your partner have spent time living apart, you should provide information about your separation, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the reasons you were living apart</li>
<li>how long you were living apart</li>
<li>how you kept in touch while you were not living together.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use the information you provide to assess whether you and your partner have genuine and compelling reasons to have stayed apart.</p>
