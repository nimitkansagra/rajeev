                <p class="intro">You can include dependent children in your visa application if they meet our requirements, or they can apply for a visa based on their relationship to you.</p>
                <h2>How your children apply for a visa</h2>
<p>There are 2 ways that dependent children can apply for a visa.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may be able to include them in your visa application.</li>
<li>They may be able to apply for their own visas based on their relationship to you if you:
<ul>
<li>already have a visa</li>
<li>are applying for a visa, or</li>
<li>are a New Zealand citizen or resident.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Dependent children are not eligible for work visas.</p>

<h2>How we define dependent children</h2>
<p>The definition of dependent children depends on their age and whether they are applying for a resident visa or a temporary visa.</p>
<h2>Resident visas for dependent children</h2>
<p>Your child is dependent if they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>24 and under, and</li>
<li>single.</li>
</ul>
<p>If they are 18 or over they must not have children of their own.</p>
<p>If they are aged 21 to 24 they must also rely on you or another adult for financial support (depending on which visa they have applied for).</p>
<h2>Temporary visas for dependent children</h2>
<h3>Primary or secondary student visas and visitor visas</h3>
<p>Your child is dependent if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>are 19 and under</li>
<li>are single, and</li>
<li>rely on you for financial support.</li>
</ul>
<p>If they are 18 or 19 they must not have children of their own.</p>
<p>If your children are 20 or older:</p>
<ul>
<li>you cannot include them in your application for a visitor or student visa</li>
<li>they cannot apply for a visitor or student visa based on their relationship with you unless they meet requirements for a tertiary student visa.</li>
</ul>
<p>If they want to join you in New Zealand they need to apply for their own visa.</p>
<h3>Tertiary student visas</h3>
<p>If you are eligible for the 2021 Resident Visa, your child may be able to study as a dependent child at tertiary level if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>live in New Zealand</li>
<li>were aged between 17 and 25 on 1 January 2022</li>
<li>meet certain requirements to be considered a dependent child</li>
</ul>
