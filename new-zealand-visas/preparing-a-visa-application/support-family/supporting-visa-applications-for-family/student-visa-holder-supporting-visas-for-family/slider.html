<h3>When your partner can support student visas for your children</h3>
<p>In some circumstances you may be able to support a work visa for your partner, but not a student visa for your dependent children. However, if your partner applies for a work visa as the partner of a student, then they may support student visas for your children.</p>
<p>For example, if you are studying a level 8 qualification that is included on the Long Term Skill Shortage List, you can support a work visa for your partner, but not student visas for your dependent children. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>you apply for a student visa</li>
<li>your partner applies for a work visa, as the partner of a student</li>
<li>your children apply for student visas as dependent children of your partner (who has a work visa).</li>
