            <p class="intro">When you arrive in New Zealand, you must apply for entry permission and answer questions about biosecurity and customs.</p>

This process is usually quick, but immigration officers may ask you some extra questions before giving you permission to enter New Zealand. You must answer these questions truthfully.</p>
<p>Immigration officers can ask you to provide evidence to support your application to enter New Zealand. They may ask to see your ticket to leave New Zealand or evidence of how you will support yourself while you are here.</p>

<ul>
<li>are visiting from a visa waiver country — that is, a country whose passport holders do not need to get a visa before they arrive in New Zealand, or</li>

<p>An NZeTA is not a visa.</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<h2>How you apply for entry permission</h2>
<p>There are 2 ways to apply — by:</p>
<ul>
<li>presenting your documents to an immigration officer, or</li>
<li>using a eGate or Smartgate — not all passport holders can use this option.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.customs.govt.nz/personal/travel-to-and-from-nz/travelling-to-new-zealand/egate/" target="_blank" class="link__external"><span class="link__title">eGate – New Zealand Customs Te Mana Arai o Aotearoa</span></a></p>
<p>To apply for entry permission, you need to have your:</p>
<ul>
<li>completed digital or paper arrival card — if paper this will be given to you on the plane or ship before you arrive</li>
<li>passport or travel document.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may need to have a travel ticket out of New Zealand to a country you have the right to enter if:</p>
<ul>
<li>we asked for that when we approved your visa, or</li>
<li>you are visiting New Zealand on a passport from a visa waiver country.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="./new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/your-journey-to-new-zealand/arriving-in-new-zealand/if-you-are-refused-entry-to-new-zealand" target="slider" data-href="./new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/your-journey-to-new-zealand/arriving-in-new-zealand/if-you-are-refused-entry-to-new-zealand/slider">If you are refused entry to New Zealand</a></p>
<h2>New Zealand Traveller Declaration</h2>
<p>Travellers arriving into New Zealand international airports now have the option to complete a digital declaration instead of a paper arrival declaration, before travelling to New Zealand. You can find out more on the New Zealand Traveller Declaration website. </p>

<h2>Customs and biosecurity</h2>
<p>Other border agencies such as the New Zealand Customs Service and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) check that you meet their entry requirements. They can refuse to let you enter New Zealand entry if you do not.</p>
