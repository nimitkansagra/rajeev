                    Acceptable standard of health criteria for visa approvals
                    
                </h1>
                <p class="intro">How we use the acceptable standard of health criteria when assessing residence and temporary visa applications.</p>
                <p>Before we can approve your residence or temporary visa application we check you meet the visa’s criteria. The criteria helps us decide if we should decline or approve your application. With the acceptable standard of health criteria, we look to see if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are a risk to public health</li>
<li>you are going to add significant cost to, or demands on, New Zealand's health services</li>
<li>you are going to qualify for Ongoing Resourcing Scheme (ORS) funding<br /><a href="https://www.education.govt.nz/school/student-support/special-education/ors/" target="_blank" class="link__external"><span class="link__title">Ongoing Resource Scheme</span></a></li>
<li>your health may stop you working or studying, if this is what the visa is for.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we consider if you meet the criteria, we cannot include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability of a person or organisation to pay for health services, pharmaceuticals, or residential care</li>
<li>your ability to access the private health system</li>
<li>any health insurance</li>
<li>the ability of family, friends, or a charitable organisation to care for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:<br />If entry to New Zealand is needed for the purpose of medical treatment or consultation, then the acceptable standard of health criteria may not apply to you</p>
<h2><strong>Assessing acceptable standard of health </strong></h2>
<p>You may need to get a medical examination as part of your application. We use this to determine if you meet the acceptable standard of health criteria.</p>
<p><a href="./new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/medical-info/when-you-need-an-x-ray-or-medical-examination" class="link__internal"><span class="link__title">Who needs a chest x-ray or medical examination</span></a></p>
<p>Results in your medical examination may mean we either:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue with your application as you meet the acceptable standard of health criteria</li>
<li>ask one of our medical assessors for their medical opinion. Our medical assessors are registered New Zealand medical practitioners, and provide their medical opinion on whether the acceptable standard of health criteria are met.</li>
</ul>
<p>The medical assessor's opinion may mean we:</p>
<ul>
<li>request further medical information from you to complete an assessment</li>
<li>continue processing your visa application as you meet the acceptable standard of health criteria</li>
<li>see if you are eligible for a medical waiver assessment as you have not met the acceptable standard of health criteria </li>
<li>decline your visa application as you have not met the acceptable standard of health criteria — we only do this when we cannot issue a medical waiver.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="./new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/medical-info/medical-waivers-for-visa-applications" class="link__internal"><span class="link__title">Medical waivers for visa applications</span></a></p>

<li>high-cost disability services.</li>
