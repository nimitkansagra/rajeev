                <p class="intro">If you are applying for a working holiday visa you may need to have a chest x-ray or medical examination as proof of your good health.</p>
                <h2>What you need to provide depends on your situation</h2>
<p>The medical information you must provide for a working holiday visa is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>how long you can stay in New Zealand under your country’s working holiday scheme</li>
<li>whether you are already in New Zealand</li>
<li>whether you have spent time in countries that do not have a low incidence of tuberculosis (TB)</li>
<li>whether you have previously had a medical examination as part of an earlier visa application — if so, you may not need to have another medical examination.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use chest x-rays to check for TB and general medical examinations to check for other medical conditions.</p>

<li>sending us your chest x-ray certificate or medical certificate if you live in a country that does not have panel physicians.</li>
