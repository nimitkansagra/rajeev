                <h2>Why we need X-rays and medical examinations</h2>
<p>If you are applying for a visa, you may need to have a chest X-ray or medical examination. It is how we decide if you meet the acceptable standard of health criteria.<br /><a href="./new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/medical-info/acceptable-standard-of-health-criteria-for-visa-approvals" target="slider" data-href="./new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/medical-info/acceptable-standard-of-health-criteria-for-visa-approvals/slider">Acceptable standard of health criteria for visa approvals</a></p>
<h2>When to get an X-ray or medical examination</h2>
<p>The application form you complete will tell you if you need to provide a chest X-ray or medical examination. </p>
<p>After you submit an application for an Accredited Employer Work Visa, or a visitor visa from a country outside of the Pacific Islands, you will be notified if you need to have a chest X-ray or medical examination.</p>
<p>Your chest X-ray and medical examination results must be no more than 3 months old when we receive your application.</p>

<h2>How to provide evidence of your X-ray or medical examination</h2>
<p>If you must have a chest X-ray or medical examination, you need to use a <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#panel-physicians" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Panel physicians" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;A doctor or radiologist who has been approved by New Zealand Immigration to complete medical&amp;#160;and chest x-ray certificates.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">panel physician</a>, who sends us your medical results electronically using our <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#emedical" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="eMedical" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;Immigration New Zealand&amp;#8217;s online health processing system, which is used by panel physicians to send us chest x-ray and medical certificates.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">eMedical</a> system. This is the quickest and most efficient way to have your health assessed.</p>
<p>If you apply for your visa using a paper form you must tell us the eMedical reference number to show you have completed your X-ray or medical examination.</p>
<p>You can see if eMedical is available by checking our panel physician list and choosing a panel physician in your country.</p>
<p>Panel physicians are doctors and radiologists who are approved to complete chest X-rays and medical examinations for New Zealand visa applications.</p>

<h3>Providing evidence if you are from a country that does not have panel physicians</h3>
<p>If you live in a country that does not have panel physicians you can visit any registered doctor, who must complete the required medical certificates and send them to us as evidence of your health.</p>
<h4>Preparing for your appointment</h4>
<p>When you go to your appointment, you need to take:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 recent passport-sized photos that are less than 6 months old – you only need 1 photo if you are having a chest X-ray</li>
<li>copies of the required medical certificate forms for the doctor to complete and send to us. </li>
</ul>
<p>All medical certificates must be completed in English.</p>
