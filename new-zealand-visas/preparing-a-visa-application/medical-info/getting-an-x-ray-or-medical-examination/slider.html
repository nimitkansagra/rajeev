<p>The visa criteria and application form will tell you if you need a chest X-ray or medical examination.</p>
<p>If you need a medical examination, you normally get a 'general medical examination' unless you need a limited medical examination. A general medical examination is sometimes called a 'full medical examination'.</p>
<p>Check the situations where you need an X-ray or medical examination, and the different types of examinations.</p>

<p>If you are menstruating (having a period), you need to wait until your period finishes before having your medical examination. You cannot have your medical examination during your period because the blood can affect your urine test.</p>
<p>For an Accredited Employer Work Visa or Visitor Visa, if we need you to have a chest X-ray or medical examination, we give you an Immigration New Zealand health case reference number (NZHR). Give the NZHR to the clinic when you make your appointment.</p>

<h3>Authority to collect medical information</h3>
<p>At your medical appointment, you must sign a form to allow the doctor to send your medical information to us.</p>
<p>If you are 17 years old or younger, your parent or guardian must sign the form for you.</p>
<p>If your doctor is using eMedical, they will give you an eMedical client consent and declaration form to sign. You can read the form before your appointment:</p>

<h3>What happens at the medical examination</h3>
<p>There are 3 parts to the medical examination:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">medical history and physical examination</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">urine and blood tests</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">chest X-ray, if required.</li>
</ul>
<p>The doctor checks your height, weight, mental state, hearing and vision, listens to your heart and lungs, feels your abdomen and checks your reflexes and other parts of your nervous system.</p>
<p>A nurse or health care assistant may complete parts of the examination.</p>
<p>You will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">remove some items of clothing for the physical examination</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">provide a urine sample during the medical examination</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">get blood tests, and possibly a chest X-ray or other tests if needed — the clinic will tell you if you need these, and you may need to go to different places to get some tests done.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paying for your medical examination</h3>
<p>You must pay any costs related to your X-ray and medical examinations.</p>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_note">
