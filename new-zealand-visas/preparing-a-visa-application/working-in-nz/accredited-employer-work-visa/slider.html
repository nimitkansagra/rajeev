                <p class="intro">On 27 November 2023 the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) changed to include a maximum continuous stay and a longer visa length.</p>
                <h2>Changes to the AEWV</h2>
<p>On 27 November 2023, we introduced a 'maximum continuous stay' for everyone with an AEWV. This is 5 years for people paid at or above the <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#median-wage" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Median wage" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link__title&quot;&gt;The median wage is a pay rate based on information from Stats NZ about how much people earn in New Zealand each year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The median wage that Immigration New Zealand uses comes from the 'median hourly earnings from wages and salaries' published by Stats NZ in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The median wage we are using:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;is $29.66 for 27 February 2023 to February 2024&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;will be $31.61 from February 2024 to February 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;link__internal&quot; href=https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/working-in-nz/accredited-employer-work-visa/"https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/working-in-nz/wage-rate-requirements-for-visas"><span class=&quot;link__title&quot;&gt;Wage rate requirements for visas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;link__external&quot; href=https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/working-in-nz/accredited-employer-work-visa/"https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/?filters=Labour%20market%20statistics%20%28income%29%2cLabour%20market%22 target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link__title&quot;&gt;Labour market statistics &amp;#8211; Stats NZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">median wage</a>. </p>
<p>We also increased the maximum visa length of the AEWV to 5 years for people earning at least the median wage. For people in the care workforce sector paid at or above NZD$26.16 an hour or equivalent salary, the AEWV length increases to 3 years.</p>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_example">
<div class="inz_note_title">Example</div>
<p>From 27 November 2023, if you get an AEWV and you are paid at least the median wage:</p>
<ul>
<li>your visa may last for up to 5 years (maximum visa length)</li>
<li>you can spend up to 5 years on 1 or more AEWVs (maximum continuous stay)</li>
<li>after 5 years if you want another AEWV you must spend at least 12 months in a row outside New Zealand first (time spent outside New Zealand)</li>
<li>after you spend the required time outside New Zealand you may be eligible for a further AEWV for up to 5 years.</li>

<p>There are no changes for people employed on a Fishing Crew Work Visa and working at sea.</p>
</div>
<h4>Maximum visa length is not always the same as the maximum continuous stay</h4>
<p>The maximum visa length is not always the same length of time as the maximum continuous stay.</p>
<p>If the maximum continuous stay is longer than the maximum visa length for your role, any further AEWVs you get can only be approved for up to the length of the maximum continuous stay.</p>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_example">
<div class="inz_note_title">Example</div>
<p>You are a bus driver in the transport sector paid below median wage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your maximum visa length is 3 years.</li>
<li>Your maximum continuous stay is 5 years.</li>
<li>You can get a 3-year AEWV (the maximum visa length).</li>
<li>Before the end of 3 years, you can apply for a second AEWV, but the visa length can only be up to 2 years. This is because your total maximum continuous stay is 5 years.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>Calculating time for maximum continuous stays</h4>
<p>We count your maximum continuous stay from:</p>
<ul>
<li>when your first AEWV was issued, or</li>
<li>when you arrived in New Zealand on an AEWV, if your AEWV was issued while you were outside New Zealand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you have already spent the required time outside New Zealand, any time spent on an AEWV approved before 27 November 2023 — including time spent on an AEWV paid below the median wage — counts towards the maximum continuous stay.</p>
<p>Your maximum continuous stay resets after you spend the required time outside New Zealand.</p>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_note">
<div class="inz_note_title">Note</div>
<p>You can have multiple shorter AEWVs that add up to your maximum continuous stay. For example, if your maximum continuous stay is 5 years, it can include a 3-year visa and a 2-year visa.</p>
</div>
<p>Your maximum continuous stay does not include time spent on:</p>
<ul>
<li>temporary visas such as visitor and student visas</li>
<li>other work visas such as post study, partnership or working holiday visas</li>
<li>an Interim Visa.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When you reach your maximum continuous stay</h4>
<p>When you reach the maximum continuous stay, you must leave New Zealand for at least the required amount of time to be eligible for another AEWV. Refer to table 'AEWV length, maximum continuous stay and time outside New Zealand effective from 27 November 2023'.</p>
<p>You must spend at least 12 months in a row outside New Zealand if you are paid:</p>
<ul>
<li>the median wage or above, or</li>
<li>below the median wage in a role other than meat and seafood processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must spend at least 4 months in a row outside New Zealand if you are paid below the median wage in a meat or seafood processing role.</p>
<p>At any time, if you have spent the required time outside New Zealand, even if you have not yet reached the maximum continuous stay period:</p>
<ul>
<li>you will be able to apply for another AEWV</li>
<li>your new AEWV visa length will be the maximum for your role, and</li>
<li>the maximum continuous stay of your AEWV will be reset.</li>
</ul>
<h4>If you are on a pathway to residence</h4>
<p>You will be able to apply for another AEWV without spending 12 months out of New Zealand if you can show you are on a pathway to residence.</p>
<p>This could include, for example, if you meet the skill threshold — occupational registration, qualification or income — but need more time to complete your skilled work experience.</p>
<p>We will provide more information on recognised pathways to residence in the future.</p>

<div class="inz_accordion_collapsible"><div class="inz_accordion_section_content"><h4>Roles paid at least the median wage</h4>
<p>The maximum length of an AEWV increased from 3 to 5 years. This is for applications approved from 27 November 2023 where the work is paid at least the median wage.</p>

<p>If you have already spent 12 months outside New Zealand, you may be eligible for an AEWV for up to 5 years.</p>
<h4>Care workforce roles paid below median wage</h4>
<p>For people in the care workforce sector paid at or above NZD$26.16 an hour or equivalent salary, the AEWV length increases to 3 years. This is for applications approved from 27 November 2023. </p>
<p>For workers paid NZD$26.16 an hour, this increase gives you enough time to complete the level 4 qualification and move to the higher pay rate and pathway to residence. If you move to the NZD$28.25 an hour rate, you can apply for a further AEWV to get the maximum continuous stay of 5 years.</p>
<p>For workers paid NZD$27.20 an hour, this increase gives you time to apply for residence after you have completed the required 2 years of work experience while being paid NZD$27.20 an hour.</p>
<h4>If you have an existing AEWV as part of the care workforce sector</h4>
<p>You may be able to apply for another AEWV to get your AEWV balance. Find out if you can apply.</p>

<h2><a name="applying-for-your-aewv-balance" id="applying-for-your-aewv-balance"></a>Applying for your AEWV balance</h2>
<p>You may be able to apply for the balance of the longer 5-year or 3-year visa. Your current AEWV will not extend automatically to the longer length.</p>
<p>If you apply to get the balance, you pay the normal AEWV application fee.</p>
<p>Before you apply for your balance, check the requirements for your situation and what you should consider.</p>
<h3>Order we process applications with a reused job token</h3>
<p>Applications for the AEWV balance with a reused <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#job-token" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Job token" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;A unique number that represents one of the jobs an accredited employer is approved to hire migrants for.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A job token is also known as a &amp;#8216;unique link&amp;#8217; because it is the link sent to migrants to apply for an Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV). A job token is used to track the status of a job. For example, when a migrant opens the link and accepts the request, the job token is marked as &amp;#8216;in progress&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">job token</a> will go into a queue. We generally process applications in the order we receive them. However, for these balance applications we generally only start processing an application when your current AEVW expiry date is within the next 9 months.</p>
<p>In the unlikely situation that your current AEWV expires before we complete your application, you can get an Interim Visa for up to 6 months so you can stay and continue working.</p>
<p>If you have a partner or dependent children applying for further visas, their applications are also put in a queue. We process their applications once we decide your application.</p>
<p>We expect a large number of people to apply for their balance of 5 years. This processing order manages demands on processing resources, while ensuring we treat visa applications fairly.</p>

<h4>Care workforce paid at least NZD$28.25 an hour</h4>
<p>If you are in the Care Workforce and paid at least NZD$28.25, you can apply for a new AEWV with a visa length of up to 3 years, instead of applying for your balance with a reused job token.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you apply with a reused token the total time across your existing visa and second visa can only add up to 3 years. You need to meet the requirements to apply with a reused job token.</li>
<li>If you apply for a new AEWV, you can get the maximum continuous stay of up to 5 years across your 2 visas. Your employer needs to do a new Job Check and send you a new job token to apply. You and your employer must meet the usual requirements for an AEWV.<br /><a href="./new-zealand-visas/visas/visa/accredited-employer-work-visa" class="link__internal"><span class="link__title">Accredited Employer Work Visa</span></a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="who-can-apply-with-a-reused-job-token" id="who-can-apply-with-a-reused-job-token"></a>Who can apply with a reused job token</h4>
<p>You must meet these requirements to be eligible for the balance of the longer visa length using a reused job token.</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have an AEWV that was approved before 27 November 2023.</li>
<li>Your current AEWV must be for work paid at or above the median wage that was in place when you applied for the visa, or for work in the care workforce sector paid at least NZD$26.16.</li>
<li>You must have the same employer, job title, and work location as in your current AEWV.</li>
<li>You must be paid at the same pay rate or above the rate listed in your current AEWV.</li>

</ul>
<p>If you cannot apply with a reused job token, you may be able to apply for a new AEWV. Your employer needs to do a new Job Check and send you a new job token to apply.

<h4>When to apply for your balance</h4>
<p>You should consider waiting until closer to when your current AEWV expires before applying.</p>
<p>If you apply early and your situation changes, you may need to apply for a different visa or change the conditions of your current visa (variation of conditions).<br /><a href="./new-zealand-visas/already-have-a-visa/your-visa-conditions/variation-of-conditions-temporary-visas/varying-a-work-visa" class="link__internal"><span class="link__title">Changing the conditions of a work visa or applying for a Job Change</span></a></p>
<p>You should consider if any medical or police certificates will still be valid at the time you apply.</p>
<h4>How to apply</h4>
<ol>
<li>Your employer sends you a request to apply for a further AEWV with a reused job token.</li>
<li>You receive an email of the request.</li>
<li>You check that you meet the requirements to get your AEWV balance.<br /><a href="#who-can-apply-with-a-reused-job-token" class="link__internal"><span class="link__title">Who can apply with a reused job token</span></a></li>
<li>You accept the request. Click the Immigration Online link in the email to start the application for a further AEWV.</li>
</ol>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_note">

</div></div></div></div>
<h3>Partners and children</h3>
<p>If you meet the requirements, your partner and any dependent children are also eligible for a further visa to match the length of your further AEWV. If they apply for a further visa, they must meet the usual visa requirements and pay the fees for their applications.</p>
<h4>Conditions for partners</h4>
<p>The AEWV conditions for partners changed in May 2023.</p>

<p>If your partner has a visa with open work conditions assessed under the previous policy settings (applications submitted before 31 May 2023), the conditions of their new visa may change.</p>
<p>This could mean that for some people, existing open work conditions on their visa are replaced with new, more restricted conditions.</p>
<p>Partners should consider this when deciding to apply for a further visa.</p>
<h2><a name="employers" id="employers"></a>Employers with workers who can apply for their balance</h2>
<p>If you are an accredited employer, you can support your employee to apply for their visa balance if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are paying them at least the median wage, or</li>
<li>you employ them as part of the care workforce sector agreement.</li>
</ul>
