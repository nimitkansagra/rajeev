                    Your employer's commitments to hire you on an AEWV
                    
                </h1>
                <p class="intro">If your employer is hiring you on an Accredited Employer Work Visa they must meet NZ employment law and other commitments, including giving you specific settlement support.</p>
                <h2>Meet New Zealand law</h2>
<p>Migrant workers have the same rights as New Zealand workers and your employer must comply with New Zealand employment laws and standards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.employment.govt.nz/starting-employment/rights-and-responsibilities/" target="_blank" class="link__external"><span class="link__title">Rights and responsibilities | Employment New Zealand</span></a></p>
<p>Your employer must pay all costs and fees inside and outside New Zealand for your recruitment. You may have to pay the visa application fee, immigration agent costs if any, and airfares.</p>
<h2>Give you settlement support</h2>
<p>Your employer must provide support for your stay in New Zealand to do the job you have been hired for.</p>
<p>They must give you work-related settlement information within one month of you starting your job, including:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">how to get an Inland Revenue (IRD) number</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">relevant industry training and qualification information and options</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">specific job or industry hazards</li>

</ul>
<h2>Let you complete employee learning modules</h2>
<p>Your employer must give you time to complete all of Employment New Zealand's most recent online employee modules on employment rights during paid work hours, within one month of your employment starting.</p>
<p>Your employer must keep records of all of the modules being completed.</p>

<h2>If you are concerned about your treatment</h2>
<p>You can complain about your treatment in the New Zealand workplace and it will not affect your visa. We want you to tell us about anything you feel is unfair or unsafe at your workplace.</p>
