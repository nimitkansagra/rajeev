                <p class="intro">If you are working in New Zealand on a Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Limited Visa you can give your employer permission to deduct money from your pay to cover some costs.</p>
                <h2>Costs that can be deducted from your pay</h2>
<p>If you are a seasonal worker on an RSE Limited Visa you can give your employer permission to deduct money from your pay to cover costs like:</p>
<ul>
<li>your share of the cost of travelling to New Zealand</li>
<li>living expenses such as accommodation, food and electricity</li>
<li>health costs and insurance.</li>
</ul>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_alert">
<div class="inz_note_title">Alert</div>
<p>Deductions must comply with New Zealand employment law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.employment.govt.nz/hours-and-wages/pay/deductions/" target="_blank" class="link__external"><span class="link__title">Deductions | Employment New Zealand</span></a></p>
</div>
<h2>Giving permission for deductions</h2>
<p>Your employer can only make deductions if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have given written consent for the deductions — without pressure from your employer</li>
<li>they are clearly listed in your employment agreement</li>
<li>we approved them when your employer submitted their Approval to Recruit</li>
<li>they are fair and reasonable, and used to cover actual expenses — for example, a deduction for accommodation covers the actual cost of your employer providing a suitable place for you to live.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Withdrawing permission</h3>
<p>You can withdraw by giving your employer notice in writing.</p>
<p>Your employer must vary or stop the deductions within 2 weeks of getting notice from you, or as soon as it is practical to make the changes.</p>
