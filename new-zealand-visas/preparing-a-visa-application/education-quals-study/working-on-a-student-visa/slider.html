<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">you study full-time for at least 1 academic year</li>

</ul>
<h4>Courses of at least 14 teaching weeks</h4>
<p>You can work part-time if <strong>all</strong> of these apply:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">your study is full-time</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">your study is for at least 14 consecutive weeks</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">you are studying English language, and</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">your study is with a university, or an education provider that has been assessed by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority as a Category 1 provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we assess if you are eligible for work rights, we will look at any English language study you have done on previous student visas.</p>
<p>We can count your previous English language study towards the 14 consecutive weeks if:</p>
<ul>
<li>your new study follows on from your previous study, and</li>
<li>the study is with the same education provider.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secondary school students</h3>

<div class="inz_note inz_note_note">
<div class="inz_note_title">Note</div>
<p>If you are under 18, you must have written permission from your school and your parents or legal guardian to work. You do not need written permission to work full-time in the Christmas and New Year holiday period if you are over 18.</p>
</div>
<h2>Practical experience</h2>
<p>If practical experience is a requirement of your course, we will grant you a Student Visa with conditions that allow you to work to complete it.</p>
<h2>Work you cannot do</h2>
<p>International students are not allowed to be self-employed. You must work for an employer and have an employment agreement.</p>
<p>You cannot provide commercial sexual services. This means you cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">work as a prostitute</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">operate a New Zealand prostitution business</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">invest in a prostitution business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>If your visa does not allow you to work</h2>
<p>If you meet the criteria to work but the work conditions on your eVisa, passport label or letter do not match, contact us for assistance.</p>
<p><a href="./about-us/contact" class="link__internal"><span class="link__title">Contact us</span></a></p>
<h2>Working when your course ends and you still have a visa</h2>
<p>You must only work in line with your visa's work conditions — even if your course ends and your visa is still valid.</p>
<p>If your course has ended and your visa says you can:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">work 20 hours per week, then you must only work for this long until your visa expires</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">work full-time over the summer vacation — then you must only work during this time and only while your visa is still valid.</li>
