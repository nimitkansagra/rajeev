<h2>English-speaking background from work, family and everyday life</h2>
<p>You can show us you are a competent user of English because of where you live, your family life, work background and studies. Evidence you meet our minimum standard of English can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the country or countries you live in or used to live in, and how long you were there for</li>
<li>whether you or your family speak English or any languages other than English</li>
<li>whether English language was needed in your current and past work, and at what level</li>
<li>getting qualifications that needed skill in English language.</li>
</ul>
<h2>If your background is insufficient evidence</h2>
<h3>English language tests</h3>
<p>We may ask you to provide us with an English language test result if we need further evidence that you meet the minimum standard.</p>
<p><a href="./new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/english-language/acceptable-english-language-test-results" class="link__internal"><span class="link__title">English language test results we accept</span></a></p>
<h3>English language lessons</h3>
<h5>For your partner and dependent children</h5>
<p>You can buy English language lessons for your partner and dependent children aged 16 and older, as part of your visa application.</p>
<p>You choose the lesson option when you apply. Then if your application is successful, we would approve it in principle. When you then pay for the lessons, we can fully approve your application and grant your visa. This lets your partner and dependent children improve their English after they come to New Zealand.</p>
<p>If your partner and dependent children sit an English language test, but do not get a high enough score, they may get a discount on the cost of the lessons.</p>

<h5>For principal applicants applying for a Parent Resident Visa</h5>
<p>If you (as the <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#principal-applicant" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Principal applicant" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;The&amp;#160;main person we assess against the criteria for a Resident Visa.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">principal applicant</a>) are applying for a Parent Resident Visa, you also have the option to buy English lessons as a way to meet our English language requirements.</p>
<p>Principal applicants for other visas cannot use the English lesson option as a way to meet our English language requirements.</p>
<h2>Other visas and their English language ability requirements</h2>
<p>Your visa requirements state whether or not you need to meet any minimum requirements for English. Some visas have no requirements around English language.</p>
<p>The level of English language ability is higher for skilled residence visas and cannot be met from just having an English-speaking background.</p>
