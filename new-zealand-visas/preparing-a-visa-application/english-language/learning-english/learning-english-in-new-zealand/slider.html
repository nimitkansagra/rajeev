Partners can be of the same or opposite sex.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">partner</a> and your children aged 16 and older must show that they can speak and understand English.</p>
<p>They can do this by passing language tests or by proving they already speak English.</p>

<h2>If your family does not speak English well enough</h2>
<p>If your partner and children aged 16 or older do not meet the minimum standard of English for the resident visa you are applying for, you must pay us for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) tuition before we can approve your application.</p>
<p>When your partner and children arrive in New Zealand, they can learn English in the classes you have paid for.</p>
<h2>How we work out the cost of English classes</h2>
<p>The cost of ESOL classes depends on how well each member of your family can speak English.</p>
<p>If your partner and children (aged 16 and over) speak some English, they can take an English language test to find out what their level of English is. We use the test scores to decide how much tuition they will need. The higher their test score, the less you pay for their tuition.</p>
<p>Their test results must be no more than 2 years old when we accept your application.</p>

<div class="inz_note_title">Alert</div>
<p>If they are not able to speak English at all or do not take the test, you must pay the maximum charge for their English language tuition.</p>

<h3>Applying for a Parent Resident Visa</h3>
<p>If you are applying for a Parent Resident Visa and you do not have an English-speaking background, you pay the minimum charge no matter how well you speak and understand English.</p>
<h2>English language tests you can take</h2>
<p>We only accept results from some organisations that offer English language tests.</p>

<h2>Paying for ESOL classes</h2>
<p>After we approve your application in principle and before we grant you a resident visa, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>let you know the total amount you need to pay us for your ESOL tuition, and</li>
<li>ask you to complete an agreement covering each person that needs ESOL tuition.</li>
</ul>
<p>The agreement explains the conditions of the ESOL tuition and gives information about the TEC. We send 2 copies:</p>
<ul>
<li>sign and return one to us together with your payment, and</li>
<li>keep the other for your records — your family must take this to their English classes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who provides the classes</h2>
<p>The TEC is the New Zealand government agency that arranges ESOL tuition. We pay your class fees to the TEC.</p>
<h2>Where you can learn English</h2>
<p>There are many different courses and course providers in all parts of New Zealand teaching English for speakers of other languages.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.live-work.immigration.govt.nz/live-in-new-zealand/english-language/find-an-english-language-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link__external"><span class="link__title">Find an English language class</span></a></p>
<p>The TEC website also has information about English language course details, locations and costs.</p>
<p><a href="http://tec.govt.nz/funding/funding-and-performance/funding/fund-finder/pelt/migrant-learners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link__external"><span class="link__title">Information for migrant learners | TEC</span></a></p>
<h3>Starting classes</h3>
<p>Your family has 5 years to complete their ESOL classes.</p>
<p>Most people start classes as soon as possible after they arrive in New Zealand, and find that speaking and understanding English helps them settle here successfully.</p>
<h2>If you do not come to NZ</h2>
<p>If you and your family never enter New Zealand on your resident visa, we can refund the money you paid for ESOL classes.</p>
<p>To get a refund, contact us within 6 months of your resident visa expiring.</p>
