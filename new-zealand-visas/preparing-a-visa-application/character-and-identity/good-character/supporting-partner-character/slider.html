                <p class="intro">Your partner can only support your visa application if they can show us they are of good character. They may need to provide police certificates or criminal records for proof.</p>
                <h2>Evidence your partner is of good character</h2>
<p>If you apply for a visa as the partner of a New Zealand citizen or a New Zealand visa holder, your partner must be able to show us they are of good character.</p>
<p>If your partner cannot prove they are of good character, we can grant a <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#character-waiver" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Character waiver" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;A decision to waive character requirements for a&amp;#160;person who does not meet them, so&amp;#160;we can grant them a visa.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#160;do not consider character waivers for people who have character issues&amp;#160;described in section 15 or 16 of the &lt;em&gt;Immigration Act 2009&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When we make a decision about whether we grant a&amp;#160;character waiver, we take into account things like:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;how long ago the&amp;#160;event that created&amp;#160;the character issue&amp;#160;occurred&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the circumstances surrounding the offence or incident&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the person's&amp;#160;circumstances, including their ties to New Zealand and reasons for applying for a visa&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the significance of any information falsely provided or withheld during a previous visa application (if this applies), and the person's intentions and involvement in providing or withholding this information.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;" target="_blank">character waiver</a> which means your partner will still be able to support your visa application.</p>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_note">
<div class="inz_note_title">Note</div>
<p>If your partner has any convictions for family violence or sexual offences, they cannot support your application.</p>
</div>
<h2>If your partner is a NZ citizen, resident, or visa holder</h2>
<p>Your partner must provide police certificates from any country they have lived in for 12 months or more in the last 10 years, since they turned 17. Your partner does not need to provide a New Zealand police certificate, as we will obtain one directly from the authorities.</p>
