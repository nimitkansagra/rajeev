                </h1>
                <p class="intro">You must meet the criteria of being settled, skilled or scarce for the 2021 Resident Visa.</p>
                <p>You must also meet one of these 3 criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>('settled' criteria) have lived in New Zealand for the past three or more years</li>
<li>('skilled' criteria) earn at or above the median wage (NZD $27 per hour), or</li>
<li>(‘scarce’ criteria) work in a role on a scarce list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>‘Settled’ criteria</h2>
<p>To be eligible under the ‘settled’ criteria, you must have lived in New Zealand for the past 3 or more years and</p>
<ul>
<li>have arrived in New Zealand on or before 29 September 2018, and</li>
<li>have spent a minimum of 821 days in New Zealand between 29 September 2018 and 29 September 2021 (inclusive).</li>
</ul>
<p>The time spent in New Zealand does not need to be consecutive. There is no minimum amount within a calendar year.</p>
<p>Most people will be able to work out how long they have spent outside of New Zealand in the last 3 years, but if you need to check how much time you have spent in New Zealand, you can request your travel movements from the Immigration Contact Centre. Most eligible work visa holders are expected to meet the 'settled' criteria. Immigration New Zealand (INZ) will use border movement records to decide if you meet this criteria.</p>
<p>The application form will ask about the time spent in New Zealand. You will not need to provide evidence of your 'settled' eligibility unless asked to do so by an immigration officer.</p>
<h2>‘Skilled’ criteria</h2>
<p>If you have not been here for 3 or more years you may be eligible under the ‘skilled’ criteria.</p>
<p>To meet the skilled criteria, you must be paid the median wage of NZD $27 per hour or more on 29 September 2021. Your job must be genuine full time work for an average of at least 30 hours per week.</p>
<p>Pay rates will be calculated the same way as Skilled Migrant and Essential Skills applications.</p>
<p>If you are a self-employed contractor with a consistent history of contract work and a current contract you are eligible for the 2021 Resident Visa. This is similar to the Skilled Migrant Category.</p>
<p>Applying under the skilled criteria you will need to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>an employment agreement <strong>or</strong> a letter from your employer confirming the pay and hours, <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>a full bank statement <strong>or</strong> an Inland Revenue summary of income <strong>or</strong> payslips.</li>
</ul>
<p>The documents must show you were paid at least NZD $27 each hour, both on 29 September and on the date you apply.</p>
<p>There is some flexibility if your pay or hours are temporarily reduced due to the business being affected by COVID-19 related restrictions.</p>
<p>More information may be requested by INZ when your application is being assessed to help confirm the requirements are met.</p>
<p>Applicants must also meet ‘skilled’ criteria at the time they apply. They may change to meet ‘scarce’ criteria at the time of application.</p>
<h2>'Scarce' criteria</h2>
<p>If you haven’t been here for 3 or more years and are not paid at least NZD $27 per hour, you may be eligible under the ‘scarce’ criteria.</p>
<p>To be eligible under this criteria, on 29 September 2021 you must work in a job on a scarce list. These are:</p>

<p>Applying under the ‘scarce’ criteria you need to be in genuine full time work for an average of at least 30 hours per week.</p>
<p>You will need to provide this evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>an employment agreement <strong>or</strong> a letter from your employer confirming the occupation and hours, <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>evidence of occupational registration in New Zealand (if required).</li>
</ul>
<p>More information may be requested by INZ when your application is being assessed to help confirm the requirements are met.</p>
<p>There is some flexibility if your hours are temporarily reduced due to the business being affected by COVID-19 related restrictions.</p>
<p>Applicants must also meet ‘scarce’ criteria at the time they apply. They may also change to meet ‘skilled’ criteria at the time of application instead.</p>
