                <p class="intro">If you are a dependent child and were included in a skilled residence application or Skilled Migrant Category Expression of Interest as at 29 September 2021 but are now aged 25 years or older you will be eligible for a 2021 Resident Visa, if your parent is approved a 2021 Resident Visa and you meet the health and character requirements.</p>
                <p>You must apply for a 2021 Resident Visa in your own right — you cannot be included in your parents’ application. You may submit your application as an attached document when your parents submit their online 2021 Resident Visa application.</p>
<p>A separate application form will be available for you to complete when your parents apply online.</p>
<p>2021 Resident Visa Application for a Dependent Child Aged 25 or Older (INZ 1275)</p>
<p>If you are 25 years or older and cannot be included in your parents’ application as a dependent child, you may be eligible for a 2021 Resident Visa if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you meet the dependent child requirements except for age</li>
<li>you were included in a Skilled Migrant Category Expression of Interest or skilled residence application submitted on or before 29 September 2021</li>
<li>one of your parents is granted residence under the 2021 Resident Visa category, and</li>
<li>you meet the standard health and character requirements for the 2021 Resident Visa category.</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not have to be in New Zealand to be eligible to apply.</p>
<p>No application fee or levy will be required for these applications.</p>
<p>If you are overseas you will be able to enter New Zealand once your new 2021 Resident Visa has been granted. This is consistent with how offshore family members included as secondary applicants on an application will be treated.</p>
