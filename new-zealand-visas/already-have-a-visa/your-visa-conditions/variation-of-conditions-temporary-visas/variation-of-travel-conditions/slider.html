                </h1>
                <p class="intro">You can travel in and out of New Zealand for up to 2 years on most resident visas. If you want to extend this time you need to apply for a variation of conditions.</p>
                <h2>Travelling overseas on a resident visa</h2>
<p>Most resident visas let you travel outside New Zealand as often as you like for up to 2 years — that is, you have <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#multiple-entry-travel-conditions" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Multiple entry travel conditions" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/already-have-a-visa/your-visa-conditions/variation-of-conditions-temporary-visas/variation-of-travel-conditions/"./about-us/site-information/glossary#resident-visa-travel-conditions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Travel conditions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;that allow a visa holder to enter and exit New Zealand multiple times while their visa is valid, however the holder must not exceed any maximum stay conditions on their visa (if applicable).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Visa holders with multiple entry travel conditions&amp;#160;still need to apply for entry permission each time they return to New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">multiple entry travel conditions</a>.</p>
<p>You can find your travel conditions in your eVisa, on the visa label in your passport or explained to you in a letter we sent you.</p>

<h3>If you go overseas after your travel conditions have expired</h3>
<p>If you travel from New Zealand to another country after your travel conditions have expired, your visa will expire too. You will not be allowed to come back to New Zealand unless you get another valid visa.</p>
<h2>Extending your travel conditions</h2>
<p>Apply to extend your travel conditions before you travel in and out of New Zealand if you:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">plan to stay on a resident visa for more than 2 years</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">have applied for permanent residence after 2 years on a resident visa but we have not approved your application yet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Apply for permanent residence instead</h3>
<p>Permanent residents can travel and return to New Zealand as often as they like. If you are eligible for permanent residence, you could apply for that instead of a variation to the travel conditions on your resident visa.</p>
<p><a href="./new-zealand-visas/visas/visa/permanent-resident-visa" class="link__internal"><span class="link__title">Permanent Resident Visa </span></a></p>
<h2>How long you can extend your travel conditions for</h2>
<p>Depending on your situation, you can apply to extend your multiple entry travel conditions for 1 or 2 years. If we are not able to extend your travel conditions for 1 or 2 years, we may grant you an extension for 14 days.</p>

<h4>If you are also a tax resident of another country</h4>
<p>Only New Zealand tax residents can apply to extend their travel conditions. Some countries have double tax agreements with New Zealand. If you are considered by Inland Revenue to be a tax resident in another country because of a double tax agreement, we will not consider you to be a New Zealand tax resident.</p>
