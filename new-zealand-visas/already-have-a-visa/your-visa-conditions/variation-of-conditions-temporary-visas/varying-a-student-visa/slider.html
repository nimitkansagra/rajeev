<h2>Unlimited work rights for PhD and Masters by research students</h2>
<p>If you’re enrolled in Masters by research or doctoral degree programme awarded by a New Zealand tertiary institution, there are no restrictions on the hours you can work.</p>
<h3>Practical experience</h3>
<p>You’re allowed to work, to meet a requirement of practical experience for your programme of study in New Zealand, if practical experience is a course requirement.</p>
<p>To vary your student visa to allow work you must provide:</p>
<ul>

<li>'Application for a Variation of Conditions or a Variation of Travel Conditions' (INZ 1020)</li>
<li>Application fee</li>
</ul>
<p>We won't ask for evidence you've paid the new tuition fees until we've approved in principle to vary your student visa.</p>
<p>You can change your course, provider, or the location of your study if you've met the conditions of your current student visa and are still a bona fide applicant. We must also be satisfied that your original student visa would have been granted for the new course or education provider.</p>
<p>If you currently hold a pathway student visa and wish to change your education provider, you will need to apply for a new student visa.</p>
