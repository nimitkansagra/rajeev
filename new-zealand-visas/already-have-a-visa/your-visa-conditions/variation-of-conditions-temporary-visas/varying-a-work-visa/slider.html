                <h2>Finding your visa conditions</h2>
<p>Your conditions are recorded in your eVisa, on the visa label in your passport, or explained to you in a letter we sent you.</p>

<h2>You want to change, employer, job or location</h2>
<p>If your work visa lets you work in any job, for any employer and in any location, you do not need to apply for a variation of conditions or a Job Change.</p>
<h3>What you need when applying</h3>
<p>If you are changing your job, employer or the location where you work, you need to include in your application:</p>
<ul>

<p>Your employer must be accredited to hire migrants for the AEWV and have a valid job check for your new job. You will need the job check approval number for your application.</p>
<p>If you want to change to a job paid below the median wage, it must be exempt from paying the median wage. Your current visa must also be valid for no longer than the maximum visa length allowed for roles paid below the median wage. You must apply for a new AEWV if your current visa is valid for longer than the time allowed.</p>

<h2>You want to study</h2>
<p>If you want to study for more than 3 months on a work visa, you may need to apply for a variation of conditions or a student visa.</p>
<p>Your visa must match your main purpose for being in New Zealand. If your main purpose is still to work, but your study will complement this work, then normally you need to apply for a variation of conditions. If your main purpose is to study, then you should apply for a student visa.</p>
