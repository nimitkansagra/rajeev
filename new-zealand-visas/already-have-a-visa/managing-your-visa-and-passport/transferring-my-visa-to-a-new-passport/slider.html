                <p class="intro">If you have renewed your passport, you need to transfer your valid visa into your new passport before you use it to travel. This applies for both physical visa labels and eVisas.</p>
                <p>Visas that are issued by letter are known as eVisas. Visa labels are physical labels for your passport. Both are recorded against your passport in our system.</p>
<p>We recommend you request an eVisa, as this is the quickest way to transfer your visa to your new passport and there is no application fee. You can do this online.</p>
<p>You must inform us if you get a new passport issued so that your records can be updated and you can travel to and from New Zealand.</p>
<p>Check our Fees, decision times and where to apply page to find out how long it takes to transfer your visa to a new passport.</p>
