<p>When you sign one you agree to pay a fixed amount towards repatriating any worker who breaks their visa conditions.</p>
<p>The repatriation costs can be anything up to $3000 for each worker (this includes any living and accommodation costs).</p>
<p>Your signed letter of guarantee goes with your ATR application along with the rest of your supporting documents.</p>
