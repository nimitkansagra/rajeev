            <h1>Providing accommodation for RSE workers</h1>

            <p class="intro">From the 2019/20 season, the Government has introduced changes in some regions of New Zealand to the type of accommodation you can offer your workers.</p>

            <div class="content_slider portaltype-folderoverview"><h2>Where the changes apply</h2>
<p>Restrictions apply if your Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme workers are in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Northland</li>
<li>Auckland — including upper Auckland</li>
<li>Bay of Plenty</li>
<li>Hawke’s Bay</li>
<li>Marlborough</li>
<li>Nelson and Tasman, or</li>
<li>Otago.</li>
</ul>
<p>No other regions of New Zealand are affected by the accommodation restrictions and the restrictions apply only to accommodation you are using for the first time.</p>
<p>If you are not sure where your property is located, check its legal address and council boundaries.</p>

<h3>Bay of Plenty and Hawke’s Bay</h3>
<p>Your RSE workers must not live in a <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#residential-house" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Residential house" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;For the Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme, a residential house is a self-contained house, flat, unit, townhouse or apartment designed to accommodate a household &amp;#8212; a home for families or individuals living in New Zealand on a more permanent basis. If a house is advertised online &amp;#8212; for example, through holiday or peer-to-peer websites &amp;#8212; it is still considered to be a residential house.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A residential house is not transitory accommodation used to temporarily accommodate people who would normally live outside New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">residential house</a> unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>the house was included in an Agreement to Recruit (ATR) approved before 26 September 2019, or</li>
<li>you own the house, and bought it on or before 26 September 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li>rent a residential house you have not previously used to accommodate RSE workers, or</li>
<li>buy a residential house after 26 September 2019 to accommodate RSE workers, even if you intend to significantly modify it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Auckland (including upper Auckland), Northland, Marlborough, Nelson, Tasman and Otago</h3>
<p>Your RSE workers must not live in a <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#residential-house" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Residential house" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;For the Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme, a residential house is a self-contained house, flat, unit, townhouse or apartment designed to accommodate a household &amp;#8212; a home for families or individuals living in New Zealand on a more permanent basis.

<ul>
<li>the house was included in an Agreement to Recruit (ATR) approved before 26 September 2019, or</li>
<li>you own it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot rent a residential house you have not previously used as accommodation for RSE workers. You can still buy a residential house, but the Government expects that you will plan to offer purpose-built accommodation to your workers as soon as you can.</p>
<h2>The type of housing you can offer</h2>
<p>Even though you may not be able to use a <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#residential-house" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Residential house" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;For the Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme, a residential house is a self-contained house, flat, unit, townhouse or apartment designed to accommodate a household &amp;#8212; a home for families or individuals living in New Zealand on a more permanent basis.

<ul>
<li>purpose-built seasonal worker accommodation</li>
<li>a converted or re-purposed property converted into seasonal worker accommodation</li>
<li>a house on a commercial orchard or vineyard</li>
<li>guest accommodation, such as:
<ul>
<li>a designated boarding house</li>
<li>a home-stay or billeting arrangement</li>
<li>motels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The existing quality guidelines for suitable accommodation assessed by the <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#labour-inspectorate" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Labour Inspectorate" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;The Labour Inspectorate is part of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Enterprise's Employment Services department.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the Labour Inspectorate are a team of 5 inspectors who only work in the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Scheme. Their task, set by Immigration New Zealand (INZ), is to make sure employers comply with RSE policy, specifically, pastoral care, accommodation and employment standards.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">Labour Inspectorate</a> will continue to apply.</p>
