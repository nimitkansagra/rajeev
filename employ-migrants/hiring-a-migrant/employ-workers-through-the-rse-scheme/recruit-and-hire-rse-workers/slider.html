<div class="inz_process_timeline inz_process_timeline_h2">
<div class="inz_process_timeline_step"><h2>Contact your RSE relationship manager, if required</h2>
<p>If you need help with recruiting workers contact your RSE relationship manager. They can give you guidance, as well as contact information for overseas recruitment agents.</p>
<p>When you know which country you want to hire workers from you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>travel directly to the country to do the recruitment and hiring of workers yourself (a 'direct recruitment'), or</li>
<li>contact a recruitment agent in the country you want to hire workers from. They can act on your behalf.</li>
</ul>
<div class="inz_note inz_note_warning">
<div class="inz_note_title">Warning</div>
<p>Overseas recruitment agents acting on your behalf must not charge workers for helping them find a job with you.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="inz_process_timeline_step"><h2>Support your worker's visa application</h2>
<p>Before your worker can come to New Zealand and work for you they need their Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Limited Visa. </p>
<p>If this is a direct recruitment, you support your worker's visa application. </p>
<p>If an overseas recruitment agent is acting on your behalf, send them what is needed to support your worker's application.</p>
