<h3>If a principle does not apply</h3>
<p>If you think a standard principle should not apply to your employment agreements, you must provide the reason for this with your Request for Approval in Principle (AIP) to Recruit Foreign Crew of Fishing Vessels.</p>
<h3>Steps for resolving problem and disputes</h3>
<p>If either party has a problem, there is a process for resolving problems and disputes.</p>
<h4>1. Talk to the captain</h4>
<p>If a crew member has a problem, they should talk to the captain first.</p>
<p>If at all possible the crew member should continue to work, and all the conditions of their employment agreement must be met.</p>
<h4>2. Talk to the employer</h4>
<p>If the problem cannot be resolved between the crew member and the captain, the crew member should talk to their employer.</p>
<p>If at all possible the crew member should continue to work, and all the conditions of their employment agreement must be met.</p>
<h4>3. Talk to a third party</h4>
<p>If the problem cannot be resolved between the employer and the crew member, then:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">the crew member can ask a Labour Inspector for help</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">the crew member can contact the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s (MBIE) Mediation Service, which provides mediation services to people in employee and employer and other work-related relationships.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://employment.govt.nz/resolving-problems/steps-to-resolve/mediation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-gc-link="https://employment.govt.nz/resolving-problems/steps-to-resolve/mediation/" class="link__external"><span class="link__title">Mediation | Employment New Zealand</span></a></p>
<h4>4. Take the problem to the Employment Relations Authority or Employment Court</h4>
<p>If the problem cannot be resolved by a Labour Inspector, or at mediation, then the crew member or the employer can refer the problem to the Employment Relations Authority (ERA).</p>
<p>The ERA will formally investigate the problem and make a decision that will bind both the employer and the crew member.</p>
<p>If the you or the crew member do not agree with the decision, you can file a challenge to the Employment Court. They must do so within 28 days.</p>
<p>If the crew member’s problem is about minimum or contractual entitlements, they do not have to go to the ERA first – they can take their problem straight to the Employment Court.</p>

<h4>5. Go to arbitration</h4>
<p>If the problem cannot be resolved with the help of MBIE’s mediation service, the employer or the crew member can take the problem to arbitration. The employer and the crew member can choose an arbitrator from a panel of arbitrators set up by the New Zealand Fishing Industry Guild, the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council and MBIE.</p>
<p>The arbitrator will make a decision that will bind both the employer and the crew member. Neither party can appeal the decision the arbitrator makes, unless the arbitration didn’t follow the correct process.</p>

<h4>6. Appeal to the District Court</h4>
<p>Crew members and employers can only appeal to the District Court if there was an error with the process. They cannot appeal if they simply disagree with the decision.</p>
<h3>Crew and employer rights and obligations</h3>
<h4>Representation</h4>
<p>Crew members can ask a representative for their help to resolve a dispute, including from:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">a union</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">the New Zealand Fishing Industry Guild</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">a Community Law Centre</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">a Citizens Advice Bureau.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Good faith</h4>
<p>All parties must act in good faith including:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">the employer</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">the crew member</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">the crew member’s representative, if they choose to use one.</li>
</ul>
