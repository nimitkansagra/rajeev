<h3>Advertise the role</h3>
<p>Before you can apply for a Job Check you may need to advertise to check there are no New Zealand citizens or residents available for the job.</p>
<p>This is a way of giving suitable New Zealanders the chance to apply for work before it is offered to someone from overseas, and making sure employers offer attractive wages to New Zealanders.</p>
<p>You must list the job for at least 2 weeks on a national listing website or channel where suitable New Zealanders are likely to apply, and meet other advertising requirements. Advertising must take place within the 90 days before you submit an application.</p>
<p>You will not need to give evidence of advertising if the job:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">pays at least twice the NZ median wage, or</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">is an occupation on the Green List.</li>

<li>for a role that is not a current vacancy.</li>

<div class="inz_note_title">Note</div>
<p>From 29 October 2023, accredited employers are not allowed to use trial periods in employment agreements when hiring people on an Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV). You must commit to this when applying for employer accreditation. If you have a Job Check application in progress with us and it includes an employment agreement with a trial period, we will either decline it or request updated information. </p>
<p>The 90-day trial rule will not apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job Checks approved before 29 October 2023</li>
<li>migrants who already hold, or have applied for, an AEWV based on a Job Check that was approved before 29 October 2023.</li>

</div><div class="inz_process_timeline_step"><h2>Ask the migrant to apply</h2>
<p>Once the Job Check is approved, you can ask the migrant to apply for their visa.</p>
<p>You must give them a copy of the employment agreement and a copy of the signed employment offer.</p>
<p>The required experience and qualifications for the job you offer them must match the approved Job Check.</p>
<p>You must send the migrant a request to apply from your Immigration Online dashboard. This sends an email to the migrant with a unique link also known as a <a href="./about-us/site-information/glossary#job-token" class="tooltip_content" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="" tooltip_title="Job token" data-original-title="&lt;p&gt;A unique number that represents one of the jobs an accredited employer is approved to hire migrants for.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A job token is also known as a &amp;#8216;unique link&amp;#8217; because it is the link sent to migrants to apply for an Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV). A job token is used to track the status of a job. For example, when a migrant opens the link and accepts the request, the job token is marked as &amp;#8216;in progress&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;" target="_blank">job token</a>. The migrant must open the link and accept the request before they can begin their application.</p>
<p>If their visa is approved the migrant can work in the job under the terms of their visa.</p>

<h3>Renew your accreditation</h3>
<p>Your initial accreditation lasts for 12 months before you need to renew it.</p>
<p>Once you renew it will last for:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">24 months for standard businesses, as long as it has not lapsed for 12 or more months</li>
