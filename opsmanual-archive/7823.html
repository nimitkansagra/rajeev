<p class="bodytext">Once the claimant has made an appeal to the RSAA (see C4.20.1), they are eligible to apply for further temporary permits until the final outcome of the appeal. Immigration officers may grant a temporary permit in such cases to cover the period it is likely to take to determine the appeal.</p>
