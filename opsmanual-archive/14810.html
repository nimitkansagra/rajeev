<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">An Agreement to Recruit (ATR) is an approval for a Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) to offer employment (in planting, maintaining, harvesting, and packing crops) to non-New Zealand citizen or resident workers. This approval will only be given at times where demand for such workers in the horticulture and viticulture industries cannot be met from the available New Zealand workforce.</li><li class="listletter">The availability of suitable New Zealand citizen or resident workers will be assessed in consultation with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD).</li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">WH1.10.1 Requirements for an ATR</p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">An application for an Agreement to Recruit (ATR) will only be approved where the employer holds RSE status (WH1.5).</li><li class="listletter">INZ must be satisfied that the employer has taken all reasonable steps to recruit and train New Zealand citizens or residents for available positions before seeking an ATR to recruit workers who are not New Zealand citizens or residents. Evidence to support the employer&#8217;s case for requiring an ATR must be provided with each application for an ATR.</li><li class="listletter">Each application must include the following information:<ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">the region(s) of seasonal demand; and</li><li class="listroman">the number of workers required; and</li><li class="listroman">the nature of each position (planting, maintaining, harvesting, or packing crops); and</li><li class="listroman">the period for which each position is available (start and end date of employment); and</li><li class="listroman">the location where the non-New Zealand citizen or resident workers will be working; and</li><li class="listroman">the country or countries from which the employer intends to recruit their workers; and</li><li class="listroman">a copy of the employment agreement that will be offered to the workers, and that meets the requirements set out in <a id="h11653" class="samewindowtemplate" title="WH1.20 Requirements for employment agreements under RSE policy" href="20563.html" target="_self">WH1.20</a>.<p class="listnote"><strong class="bold">Note:</strong>  The employment agreement provided to workers must be the same as that which is provided to INZ at the ATR stage, unless the terms and conditions are more beneficial to the worker.</p>
</li></ol></li><li class="listletter">Where the RSE applying for an ATR intends to recruit workers to undertake work at the worksite of a third party, such as a grower or pack house operator, they must provide written evidence of that arrangement with the third party. Such arrangements between RSEs and third parties do not remove any of the RSEs&#8217; obligations under this policy (except where <a id="h11664" class="samewindowtemplate" title="WH1.5 Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE)" href="14808.html" target="_self">WH1.5.5 (d)</a> applies).</li><li class="listletter">Where two or more RSEs have an arrangement to provide consecutive periods of employment to the same workers, they must submit their separate ATRs (covering each consecutive period) to INZ together. Where INZ approves those jointly submitted ATRs, workers will be able to apply for a further permit to work for the second or subsequent RSEs without the need to depart from New Zealand.<p class="listnote"><strong class="bold">Note: </strong> In any case the maximum stay in New Zealand of seven months in any 11 month period (or nine months in any 11 month period for citizens of Tuvalu or Kiribati who are normally resident in Tuvalu or Kiribati) must be adhered to.</p>
</li><li class="listletter">INZ must be satisfied that the employer will make available appropriate pastoral care to workers.
