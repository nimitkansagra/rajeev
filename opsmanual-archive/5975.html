<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">All references to the Immigration Act within this chapter refer to the Immigration Act 1987, as subsequently amended.</li><li class="listletter">To make immigration decisions under the Immigration Act 1987 a person must be designated by the Secretary of Labour as an immigration officer or visa officer or refugee status officer.</li><li class="listletter">In addition, from time to time the Minister of Immigration may delegate some of his or her powers under the Immigration Act to immigration officers, visa officers or refugee status officers.  These delegations are listed in schedules (see A15.4).  Some delegations are for a whole class of officers (eg for all technical advisors); some can only be exercised by officers in particular roles, and are not related to a position in the hierarchy.  Further, delegations may effectively act as an administrative constraint on the exercise of statutory decision-making powers.</li><li class="listletter">Where a person has not been designated as an immigration officer, visa officer or refugee status officer, they cannot make any immigration decisions.  In addition, the Minister may not delegate any other powers to a person who is not an immigration officer or a visa officer.</li><li class="listletter">In order to make a removal order under section 54 of the Act, an immigration officer must be specifically designated by the chief executive for that purpose.  Only such officers may cancel removal orders under section 58.  However, an immigration officer may not make a removal order in respect of a person if that officer has previously been involved in determining an application by that person for a permit (section 54(2) of the Act).</li><li class="listletter">A person who is designated as a refugee status officer cannot also consider applications as an immigration officer, and vice versa (section 129E (3) of the Act).</li><li class="listletter">The chief executive of the Department of Labour may at any time revoke a designation (section 133A of the Act).</li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">A15.1.5 Designations</p>

<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">An immigration warrant is evidence of an immigration officer's designation.  The warrant does not in itself confer any powers on the officer that are not conferred by any of the provisions of the Act (section 133(2) of the Act).</li><li class="listletter">Whenever an immigration officer (including any member of the Police or any customs officer exercising the powers of an immigration officer), seeks entry to any premises, building, or craft in the course of the officer's duties under the Act, they must produce their warrant of designation and, if requested, state the provision or provisions of the Act under which they are entitled to enter the premises, building, or craft (section 133(3) of the Act).</li><li class="listletter">An immigration officer (including any member of the Police or any customs officer exercising the powers of an immigration officer) must also produce their warrant of designation if asked to do so by any person of whom the officer orally makes any request or requirement or demand under any of the provisions of Parts 2 to 4 of the Act (section 133(4) of the Act).</li><li class="listletter">A customs officer exercising the powers of an immigration officer can meet the requirement in A15.1.10 (c) by producing evidence of their appointment as a customs officer.  A member of the Police can do so by being in uniform or by producing their badge or other evidence of being a member of the Police (section 133(5) of the Act).</li><li class="listletter">Warrants must be:<ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">in a secure place when not in use; and</li><li class="listroman">used only by the officer to whom it is issued; and</li><li class="listroman">produced in circumstances where production is required by law (as described in A15.1.10(b) and (c) above); and</li><li class="listroman">returned to the Department of Labour for revocation when the officer leaves the department or moves to a position which does not require them to exercise the functions of an immigration officer.</li></ol></li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">A15.1.15 Process for being designated as an immigration officer and issued a warrant</p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">To be designated as an immigration officer and issued with a warrant, a person must:<ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">complete a training schedule (coordinated by Immigration New Zealand trainers); and</li><li class="listroman">be deemed competent to carry out the functions of an immigration officer. </li></ol><p class="listcontinue">However, the Secretary of Labour may otherwise designate an individual as an immigration officer and issue a warrant as he or she sees fit.</p>
