<p class="bodytext">SSE approval in principle is an approval for employers in the horticulture and viticulture industries to offer employment (to plant, maintain, harvest or pack crops) to workers who hold SSE work permits (see <a id="h22729" class="samewindowtemplate" title="WH4.10 Supplementary Seasonal Employment (SSE) work permit" href="20562.html" target="_self">WH4.10</a>).</p>

<p class="headingopsmanual">WH4.5.10 Determining an application for SSE approval in principle</p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">SSE approval in principle will only be granted where: <ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">INZ is satisfied that an employer is a New Zealand employer as set out at <a id="h11664" class="samewindowtemplate" title="WH1.5 Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE)" href="14808.html" target="_self">WH1.5.1</a>; and </li><li class="listroman">INZ is satisfied that an employer meets the requirements set out at WH4.5.5 above; and </li><li class="listroman">INZ is satisfied that the employer has established a relationship with the appropriate regional Work and Income office(s) concerning their seasonal labour requirements; and </li><li class="listroman">INZ, in consultation with MSD and relevant industry bodies, is satisfied that there are no suitable New Zealand citizen or resident workers available to undertake the work; and </li><li class="listroman">INZ is satisfied the employer has complied with the conditions of any previous SSE approval in principle that has been granted to the employer.</li></ol></li><li class="listletter">Where INZ is not satisfied that the number of positions requested in the SSE approval in principle is appropriate for the work required, or considers that the number of non-New Zealand citizen or resident workers the employer proposes to recruit exceeds the forecast labour shortage for the region and period requested, INZ may approve the recruitment of a lesser number of positions, or the recruitment of workers for a lesser period of work than requested. </li><li class="listletter">INZ may consult with other services of the Department of Labour, the Inland Revenue Department, the Accident Compensation Corporation, the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, and any relevant unions, agencies, and industry bodies when determining whether an employer meets the requirements set out at WH4.5.5. </li><li class="listletter">INZ will decline an application for SSE approval in principle where it considers such approval would create unacceptable risks to the integrity of New Zealand's immigration or employment laws or policies. </li></ol><p class="note"><strong class="bold">Note:</strong> To ensure that accurate information is available on the availability of suitable New Zealand citizen and resident workers in the region, a decision will not be made on an SSE approval in principle significantly in advance of the period requested. </p>
<p class="headingopsmanual">WH4.5.15 Minimum requirements for employment agreements under SSE policy</p>
<p class="bodytext">Employment agreements between employers with SSE approval in principle and non-New Zealand citizen or resident workers must:</p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">be genuine; and </li><li class="listletter">be for planting, maintaining, harvesting or packing crops in the horticulture or viticulture industry; and </li><li class="listletter">be for a period of work of no more than six months; and </li><li class="listletter">specify a 'per hour' rate (the per hour rate for any training period must be specified separately in the employment agreement); and </li><li class="listletter">where piece rates apply to the work to be performed by the worker, also specify the piece rate(s); and </li><li class="listletter">provide that the worker will be paid no less than the market rate (see WH4.5.20); and </li><li class="listletter">comply with all relevant employment law in force in New Zealand, such as the requirements of the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act; the Wages Protection Act; the Minimum Wage Act; the Health and Safety in Employment Act; the Employment Relations Act; and the Holidays Act.</li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">WH4.5.20 Market Rates for SSE</p>
<p class="bodytext">For the purpose of SSE policy, 'market rate' is the typical rate a New Zealand citizen or resident is paid for doing the equivalent work or training, in the same period, in the same region. The 'market rate' may be expressed in terms of a 'per hour' rate or a piece rate.</p>
<p class="headingopsmanual">WH4.5.25 Reconsideration process for applications for SSE approval in principle which are declined</p>
<p class="bodytext">There is no statutory right of appeal against the decision to decline a request for SSE approval in principle, however, INZ may reconsider a declined application where new information is promptly provided.</p>
<p class="headingopsmanual">WH4.5.30 INZ may impose further restrictions after grant of SSE approval in principle</p>
<p class="bodytext">Where INZ, in consultation with MSD, considers that the number of positions or period of work approved in the SSE approval in principle is no longer appropriate to the labour market conditions in the region (for example, if suitable New Zealand citizen or resident workers become available due to a redundancy situation), further restrictions may be imposed on the number of positions or period of work that had been approved in the SSE approval in principle.  </p>
<p class="bodytext">INZ will notify an employer in writing of any further restrictions imposed on the number of positions or period of work that had been approved in the employer&#8217;s SSE approval in principle.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="bold">Note:</strong> Any further restrictions on the number of positions or period of work will only apply from the date of the written notification from INZ.  The employment of non-New Zealand citizen or resident workers who commenced employment under SSE policy with the employer before that date will not be affected by the further restrictions.</p>
