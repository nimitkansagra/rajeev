<p>As a new migrant all those years ago Settlement Support network personally helped me to get started and pointed me in the right direction by introducing me to the New Kiwis program, etc. (conducted by the Auckland Chamber of Commerce). However, I know the migrant journey isn’t an easy one and most new migrants don’t know where to go or who to ask. Therefore, I am all the more passionate about this role as I am now in a position where I can help those who come in to our city to get settled in by being that “go to” person. The Welcoming Communities Coordinator’s role is part of the Thriving Communities group of the Rotorua Lakes Council.</p>

She has lived the majority of her life in East Africa but was educated in Scotland and New Zealand. In 2018, Heather moved back to New Zealand as a single mother with 3 daughters.

This ultimately led her to become a member of the Welcoming Communities Advisory Group in Central Otago, which has evolved into the role of Welcoming Communities Officer.
