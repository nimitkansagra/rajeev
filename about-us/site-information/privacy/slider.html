                <h2>Privacy statement</h2>
<p>This statement covers all information collected or held by INZ from all sources and in all formats.</p>
<p>You can access the personal information we hold about you.</p>
<h2>Registered users</h2>

<h2>Collecting information for visas or New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) requests</h2>

<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">whether you are eligible for an NZeTA.</li>
</ul>
<p>The collection of your information is authorised by the Immigration Act 2009 (the Act) and the Immigration Regulations under the Act.</p>
