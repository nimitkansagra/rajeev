<p class="headingopsmanual">S4.35.1 Objective</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Afghan Emergency Resettlement Category provides a specific, time-limited humanitarian residence category for citizens of Afghanistan who evacuated from Afghanistan to New Zealand before 12 September 2021, who were granted a Critical Purpose Visitor visa between 15 August 2021 and 12 September 2021 (inclusive) or between 8 November 2021 and 15 March 2022 (inclusive) by the Associate Minister of Immigration, or who were granted a Critical Purpose Visitor visa as they met defined resettlement criteria and who may still travel to and enter New Zealand.</p>
<p class="headingopsmanual">S4.35.5 Overview</p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">Due to concerns for their welfare and security, the New Zealand Government facilitated the evacuation of Afghan citizens from Afghanistan with links to New Zealand through their work or close family connections, or who had other humanitarian reasons for travel to New Zealand. In some cases, immediate families of these Afghan citizens were also granted visas to travel to New Zealand. This facilitation included granting visas for travel to New Zealand, as well as evacuation flights.</li><li class="listletter">Once in New Zealand, those evacuated are able to apply for a permanent resident visa under the Afghan Emergency Resettlement Category.</li><li class="listletter">An application under the Afghan Emergency Resettlement Category will be approved if the requirements in S4.35.15 are met.</li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">S4.35.10 Making an application</p>
