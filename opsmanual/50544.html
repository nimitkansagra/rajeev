<p class="bodytext">For the purpose of these instructions, a Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) is a New Zealand employer whose core area of business is horticulture or viticulture and who has had an application for RSE status approved by INZ. An RSE is able to apply for an Agreement to Recruit (ATR) that will allow them to recruit workers who are not New Zealand citizens or residence class visa holders under the RSE Instructions.</p>
<p class="headingopsmanual">WH1.5.1 Definition of a New Zealand employer under RSE Instructions</p>
<p class="bodytext">A New Zealand employer for the purposes of RSE Instructions is an employer who:</p>

</li><li class="listletter">Where INZ, in consulting with other agencies, receives information that may be prejudicial to the positive outcome of an employer's application for RSE status, that adverse information will be put to the employer for comment before a decision is made on their application. </li><li class="listletter">INZ will decline an application for RSE status where it considers granting RSE status to the employer would create unacceptable risks to the integrity of New Zealand's immigration or employment laws or policies.</li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">WH1.5.15 Evidential requirements</p>
