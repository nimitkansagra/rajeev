<p class="bodytext">Employment agreements between employers with SSE approval in principle and non-New Zealand citizen or residence class visa holder workers must:</p>

<p class="bodytext">For the purpose of SSE instructions, 'market rate' is the typical rate a New Zealand citizen or residence class visa holder is paid for doing the equivalent work or training, in the same period, in the same region. The 'market rate' may be expressed in terms of a 'per hour' rate or a piece rate.</p>
<p class="headingopsmanual">WH3.5.20 Reconsideration process for applications for SSE approval in principle which are declined</p>
<p class="bodytext">There is no statutory right of appeal against the decision to decline a request for SSE approval in principle, however, INZ may reconsider a declined application where new information is promptly provided.</p>
<p class="headingopsmanual">WH3.5.25 INZ may impose further restrictions after grant of SSE approval in principle</p>
<p class="bodytext">Where INZ, in consultation with MSD, considers that the number of positions or period of work approved in the SSE approval in principle is no longer appropriate to the labour market conditions in the region (for example, if suitable New Zealand citizen or residence class visa holder workers become available due to a redundancy situation), further restrictions may be imposed on the number of positions or period of work that had been approved in the SSE approval in principle.</p>
<p class="bodytext">INZ will notify an employer in writing of any further restrictions imposed on the number of positions or period of work that had been approved in the employer's SSE approval in principle.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="bold">Note:</strong> Any further restrictions on the number of positions or period of work will only apply from the date of the written notification from INZ.
