<p class="bodytext">Information alleging a person may be in New Zealand unlawfully or that a person may otherwise be liable for deportation can come from a variety of sources.

This may be achieved by establishing a person's identity and immigration status from Immigration New Zealand files or database or other documentation.</p>
