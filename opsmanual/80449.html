<p id="t80449" class="heading3">S4.25 Community Organisation Refugee Sponsorship Category Pilot (25/07/2022)</p>
<p class="headingopsmanual">S4.25.1 Objective</p>
<p class="bodytext">The objective of the Community Organisation Refugee Sponsorship (CORS) category pilot is to: </p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">provide an opportunity for community organisations to actively engage in supporting successful refugee settlement and to build local communities that welcome refugees; and </li><li class="listletter">enable sponsored refugees, with the support of community organisations, to quickly become independent and self-sufficient so that they are able to enter the labour market, navigate their communities and access mainstream services without requiring additional support; and </li><li class="listletter">provide an alternative form of admission for refugees to complement New Zealand&#8217;s refugee quota and, in doing so, demonstrate New Zealand&#8217;s response to the scale of refugee movement and commitment to international responsibility sharing. </li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">S4.25.5 Overview </p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">The extended CORS category pilot will operate with an intake of up to 150 mandated refugees over a three-year period ending 30 June 2024. </li><li class="listletter">Approved community organisations are selected through an application process (S4.25.35). </li><li class="listletter">An approved community organisation may elect to support: <ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">mandated refugees which the organisation has nominated; and/or </li><li class="listroman">mandated refugees who have been identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and matched by Immigration New Zealand (INZ) with an approved community organisation. </li></ol></li><li class="listletter">The CORS category extended pilot is only open to mandated refugees who are residing in a country that is a UNHCR priority area and one of the international regions Immigration New Zealand&#8217;s Refugee Quota Programme resettles from (Africa, the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East). </li><li class="listletter">An approved community organisation must provide settlement services to supported refugees for two years. </li></ol><p class="note"><strong class="bold">Notes: </strong><br>- A mandated refugee under these instructions is someone who falls within the UNHCR International Protection Mandate and is recognised as meeting the definition of refugee under the Refugee Convention. <br>- If the evidence provided by the applicant does not show they have been recognised as a refugee under the Refugee Convention by the UNHCR or their host country, then the assessing officer may refer the expression of interest to INZ&#8217;s Refugee Status Unit for advice about recognition of the person. <br>- A UNHCR priority area is an area or population defined in the annually published UNHCR Projected Global Resettlement Needs report. </p>
<p class="headingopsmanual">S4.25.7 Requirements for a Community Organisation to become an approved organisation </p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">Approved community organisation status will be granted where an immigration officer who is the National Manager of Refugee Migrant Services is satisfied that a community organisation: <ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">is a legal entity (such as incorporated society, registered company, registered charitable trust or religious organisation with legal standing); and </li><li class="listroman">has the financial resources to provide settlement services to sponsored refugees for two years; and </li><li class="listroman">has experience working successfully with refugees or other vulnerable people; and </li><li class="listroman">has capability and capacity to secure suitable accommodation, and support mandated refugees to enter the labour market and secure meaningful and sustainable employment; and </li><li class="listroman">has entered into a Deed of Agreement for Services with INZ for the provision of settlement services to the agreed standard. </li></ol></li><li class="listletter">An application for approved community organisation status will be declined if it is considered approval would create unacceptable risks to the integrity of New Zealand's immigration laws or policies. </li><li class="listletter">To apply for approval, a community organisation must complete the Approved Community Organisation application form (INZ 1238) and provide evidence that demonstrates they meet requirements set out in (a) above. </li></ol><p class="note"><strong class="bold">Note:</strong> The Deed of Agreement for Services is a contract which sets out the settlement services the approved Community Organisation will provide to refugees it supports along with the performance measurement framework to assess the provision of settlement services, evaluation and reporting requirements. </p>
<p class="headingopsmanual">S4.25.8 Approval in principal process </p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">An application for approved community organisation status will be approved in principle at such time the National Manager of Refugee Migrant Services (RMS) is satisfied that all requirements necessary to demonstrate eligibility under the relevant instructions have been met with the exception of S4.25.7(a)(v). </li><li class="listletter">The National Manager of RMS will consult with RMS Senior Advisors when determining whether the community organisation meets the requirements for approval in principle. </li><li class="listletter">Where, in consulting with RMS Senior Advisors, information is received which may be prejudicial to the positive outcome of the community organisation status application, that adverse information will be put to the community organisation for comment before a decision is made on their application. </li><li class="listletter">The date of approval in principle is the date of the letter to the community organisation advising that approval in principle has been given. </li><li class="listletter">If the outstanding requirement is not fulfilled within 90 days, the application must be declined. </li><li class="listletter">Subject to S4.25.9(a) below, an approved community organisation will retain their approved status for the duration of the pilot. </li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">S4.25.9 Revoking approval </p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">INZ may revoke a community organisation&#8217;s approved status where it considers that the community organisation&#8217;s conduct has created an unacceptable risk to the integrity of New Zealand's immigration laws or policies. </li><li class="listletter">If an immigration officer has concerns, the community organisation will be notified in writing and provided an opportunity to provide comment before a final decision to revoke approval is made. </li><li class="listletter">Any decision to revoke approval status under these instructions must be approved by an INZ Refugee Migrant Services National Manager. </li><li class="listletter">Community organisations that have their approval status revoked will be notified of this and informed of the reasons in writing. </li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">S4.25.10 Expression of interest and invitation to apply for a Community Organisation Refugee Sponsorship category pilot permanent resident visa </p>

<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">A person may express interest in applying for a CORS permanent resident visa if he or she is: <ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">a mandated refugee; and </li><li class="listroman">residing in a country that is a UNHCR priority area and one of the international regions Immigration New Zealand&#8217;s Refugee Quota Programme resettles from (Africa, the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East); and </li><li class="listroman">either: <ul class="listbullet3"><li class="listbullet3">nominated by an approved community organisation; or </li><li class="listbullet3">identified by the UNHCR as a potential candidate for the CORS pilot. </li></ul></li></ol></li><li class="listletter">A person may express interest in applying by completing the CORS expression of interest (EOI) form and submitting it to an immigration officer. </li><li class="listletter">An EOI made in the prescribed manner may be entered into the EOI Pool, and will be valid for a period of six months. EOIs that are still in the Pool after six months, or rejected because they do not meet the criteria to be invited to apply, will be withdrawn. </li><li class="listletter">EOIs are selected in the order in which they are received. </li><li class="listletter">An immigration officer may invite a person to apply if: <ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">the person has been nominated by, or matched to, an approved community organisation; and </li><li class="listroman">all people included in the expression of interest are mandated refugees; and </li><li class="listroman">the cap on approvals under the CORS category will not be exceeded as a result of an application resulting from the invitation to apply (see S4.25.5(a)); and </li><li class="listroman">the information provided: <ul class="listbullet3"><li class="listbullet3">does not indicate the presence of health or character issues that may adversely affect the ability of any person included in the expression of interest to be granted a CORS permanent resident visa; and </li><li class="listbullet3">does not indicate any person included in the expression of interest is eligible to be sponsored for residence under any other family category, including the Refugee Family Support Category; and </li><li class="listbullet3">indicates the information provided regarding the principal applicant&#8217;s age, English language proficiency, and work experience or qualifications, appears credible at face value. </li></ul></li><li class="listroman">An invitation to apply for a visa may at any time be revoked by the Minister of Immigration or an immigration officer. A revocation takes immediate effect. </li><li class="listroman">An immigration officer&#8217;s decision to issue an invitation to apply does not guarantee a positive assessment of any factor in any subsequent application for a residence class visa, or that the person will be granted a permanent resident visa. </li></ol></li><li class="listletter">Evidence that may be provided to help an immigration officer determine whether a person is recognised as a mandated refugee includes:<ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">a UNHCR Refugee Status Determination (RSD); or </li><li class="listroman">evidence of recognition of refugee status by responsible government authorities in their current country of refuge; or </li><li class="listroman">evidence that they are known to UNHCR as a Person of Concern </li></ol></li></ol><p class="note"><strong class="bold">Note:</strong> If an applicant is only able to provide evidence that they are a mandated refugee under S4.25.10(f)(iii), the immigration officer, before exercising absolute discretion whether to issue an invitation to apply, can refer the application to the Refugee Status Unit (RSU). The RSU may undertake an internal assessment of whether the person is a refugee as per the Refugee Convention, based on the information provided, before returning to the immigration officer. </p>
