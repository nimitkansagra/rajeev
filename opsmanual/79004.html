<p class="bodytext">Under section 26(4) of the Immigration Act 2009 and acting under delegated authority from the Chief Executive of the Ministry of the Business, Innovation, and Employment, I give the following general instructions as to the order and manner of processing of visa applications, effective from 13 May 2022.</p>
<p class="headingopsmanual">Residence Applications</p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">For all first priority residence applications, each category will generally be processed in lodgement date order.</li><li class="listletter">First priority will be given to:<ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">&quot;Skilled&quot; residence class visa applications (that is: 2021 Resident Visa, Skilled Migrant Category and Residence from Work). Despite the general prioritisation of applications in lodgement date order, for these applications further prioritisation criteria will apply within each of the categories:<ul class="listbullet3"><li class="listbullet3">For the 2021 Resident Visa category, where an application is made on the enhanced Immigration Online system, applications submitted from 1 March 2022 will be held and will be queued for release from 31 March 2022 until any backlog has cleared. They will generally be released for automated, and manual processing activities to be created in the enhanced Immigration Online system by expiry date of the principal applicant&#8217;s current temporary visa as at the time of the 2021 Resident Visa application (applications for people with the earliest visa expiry will be released first). Once any backlog has cleared the manner of processing described in A16.3 will apply.</li><li class="listbullet3">For the Skilled Migrant Category (SMC), priority will be given to applications with job offers where:<ul class="listbullet4-webhelp"><li class="listbullet4-webhelp">Applicants have an hourly rate equivalent to or higher than twice the median wage (currently $54.00 per hour or an annual salary of $112,320 or more);</li><li class="listbullet4-webhelp">Applicants hold current occupational registration where registration is required by immigration instructions;</li></ul></li><li class="listbullet3">For Residence from Work Category applications (Talent (Accredited Employer), Talent (Arts, Culture and Sport), South Island Contribution, Religious Worker and Long Term Skill Shortage List), priority will be given to:<ul class="listbullet4-webhelp"><li class="listbullet4-webhelp">Applications which include a job offer with an hourly rate equivalent to or higher than twice the median wage (currently $54.00 per hour or an annual salary of $112,320 or more);</li><li class="listbullet4-webhelp">Applications which include a job offer which requires occupational registration where occupational registration is required by immigration instructions;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="listroman">Partnership and Dependent Child Family Residence applications;</li><li class="listroman">Residence class visa applications under the COVID-19 Support Residence instructions;</li><li class="listroman">Applications made under the following instructions:<ul class="listbullet3"><li class="listbullet3">Variation of travel conditions on a resident visa;</li><li class="listbullet3">Resident visa holders and eligible former resident visa holders applying for a permanent resident visa;</li><li class="listbullet3">Second or subsequent residence visa.</li></ul></li><li class="listroman">Applications for a permanent resident visa under the following instructions:<ul class="listbullet3"><li class="listbullet3">Residence instructions for holders of work visas granted under the Talent (Accredited Employers) work instructions (who meet requirements set out in RW2.1)<ul class="listbullet4-webhelp"><li class="listbullet4-webhelp">Christchurch response (2019) </li><li class="listbullet4-webhelp">Global impact visa.</li><li class="listbullet4-webhelp">Afghan Emergency Resettlement Category</li><li class="listbullet4-webhelp">Refugee and Protection Category </li><li class="listbullet4-webhelp">Refugee Quota Family Reunification Category</li><li class="listbullet4-webhelp">Community Organisation Refugee Sponsorship Category Pilot</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol></li><li class="listletter">Second Priority will be given to residence class visa applications where the applicant is offshore (other than those that meet criteria for prioritisation above). </li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">All applications</p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">Applications of the same type should generally be processed in lodgement date order.</li><li class="listletter">These instructions do not prevent immigration officers according urgency to the processing of any particular visa application when the individual circumstances so warrant that. </li></ol><p class="note"><strong class="bold">Note: </strong>Processing timeliness of application types assigned the same level of priority will vary based on factors including resourcing, availability of relevantly trained immigration officers, system capacity, volumes, typical complexity of the application and can change depending on circumstances.<br><br>For the 2021 Resident Visa category, applicants are directed to use the electronic form on immigration.govt.nz appropriate to their circumstances. If this is on the enhanced Immigration Online system, refer to A16.3 as to the manner of processing that applies to those applications. The prioritisation for allocation set out above does not affect the date the application is made. An application is made on the date the application is submitted in accordance with the applicable immigration regulations.<br><br>The General Instruction as to manner of processing published at A16.3 applies to all applications made using the enhanced Immigration Online system.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The previous General Instructions dated 24 February 2022 as to the order and manner of processing of visa applications made under section 26(4) of the Immigration Act 2009 are revoked.</p>
