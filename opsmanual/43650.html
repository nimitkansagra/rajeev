</li></ol></li><li class="listletter">If the sponsor is a child aged 18 and under sponsoring a parent, the immigration officer must be satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child to grant a permanent residence visa to the parent(s).</li><li class="listletter">The immigration officer must be satisfied that the relationship between the sponsor and the applicant is credible and genuine.
