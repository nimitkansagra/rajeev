<p class="headingopsmanual">S4.25.1 Objective</p>
<p class="bodytext">The objective of the Community Organisation Refugee Sponsorship (CORS) category is to:</p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">provide an opportunity for community organisations to actively engage in supporting successful refugee settlement and to build local communities that welcome refugees; and</li><li class="listletter">enable sponsored refugees, with the support of community organisations, to quickly become independent and self-sufficient so that they are able to enter the labour market, navigate their communities and access mainstream services without requiring additional support; and</li><li class="listletter">provide an alternative form of admission for refugees to complement New Zealand&#8217;s refugee quota and, in doing so, demonstrate New Zealand&#8217;s response to the scale of refugee movement and commitment to international responsibility sharing.</li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">S4.25.5 Overview</p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">The CORS category operates as a pilot in 2017/2018.</li><li class="listletter">Approved community organisations are selected through a request for application process.</li><li class="listletter">An approved community organisation may elect to sponsor: <ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">identified mandated refugees which the organisation has nominated; and/or </li><li class="listroman">mandated refugees who have been referred to Immigration New Zealand (INZ) by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and allocated by INZ to the approved community organisation. </li></ol></li><li class="listletter">The CORS category is only open to mandated refugees who are physically present in a geographic region identified by INZ. The geographic region will coincide with one or more refugee quota selection missions undertaken by INZ.</li><li class="listletter">The pilot CORS category intake will consist of 25 mandated refugees, but may be increased to up to 30 mandated refugees in order to enable qualifying family groups to be resettled together. No more than 30 CORS permanent resident visas may be granted as a result of the pilot.</li><li class="listletter">An approved community organisation must provide settlement services to sponsored refugees for two years.<p class="listnote"><strong class="bold">Note: </strong>A mandated refugee is someone who, before arrival in New Zealand, was determined by the UNHCR to be a refugee under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.</p>
