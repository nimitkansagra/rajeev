<p class="bodytext">The Washington Accord is an international accreditation agreement for professional engineering academic degrees, between the bodies responsible for accreditation in its signatory countries. The Sydney Accord is an international mutual recognition agreement for qualifications in the fields of engineering technology.</p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">Washington Accord or Sydney Accord accredited degrees are assessed as occupying level 7 on the New Zealand Qualifications Framework (NZQF) and qualify for 50 points. A qualification is a Washington or Sydney Accord accredited degree if:<ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">	it was gained in a country that has signed the accord; and </li><li class="listroman">	it was accredited as a Washington or Sydney Accord accredited programme by the body 	representing that country; and</li><li class="listroman">	it was awarded from or after the date the country became a signatory; and</li><li class="listroman">	there is no additional information on the relevant country&#8217;s accredited qualifications list to 	indicate that the qualification is not automatically accepted as accredited under the Washington 	Accord or Sydney Accord. </li></ol></li><li class="listletter">In any case, an immigration officer may require an applicant to provide written confirmation from Engineering New Zealand (formerly IPENZ) that the qualification is a Washington or Sydney Accord accredited degree, if they are not satisfied that the qualification meets the requirements of a) above, or it is unclear as to whether the requirements of a) above have been met. In these cases, the qualification can be accepted as a Washington or Sydney Accord accredited degree if Engineering New Zealand confirms it as such.</li></ol><p class="note"><strong class="bold">Note 1</strong>: If an applicant believes their qualification may be higher than level 7, then they should apply to NZQA for an International Qualifications Assessment<br><strong class="bold">Note 2</strong>: A list of signatories to the Accords can be found on the International Engineering Alliance website: <br><a class="newwindow/tablink" title="" href="http://www.ieagreements.org/Washington-Accord/Accredited.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/signatories/</a><br><a class="samewindowlink" title="" href="http://www.ieagreements.org/accords/Sydney/signatories/" target="_self">http://www.ieagreements.org/accords/Sydney/signatories/</a></p>
