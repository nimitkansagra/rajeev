<p class="headingopsmanual">WH3.5.25 INZ may impose further restrictions after grant of SSE approval in principle</p>
<p class="bodytext">Where INZ, in consultation with MSD, considers that the number of positions or period of work approved in the SSE approval in principle is no longer appropriate to the labour market conditions in the region (for example, if suitable New Zealand citizen or residence class visa holder workers become available due to a redundancy situation), further restrictions may be imposed on the number of positions or period of work that had been approved in the SSE approval in principle.</p>
<p class="bodytext">INZ will notify an employer in writing of any further restrictions imposed on the number of positions or period of work that had been approved in the employer's SSE approval in principle.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="bold">Note:</strong> Any further restrictions on the number of positions or period of work will only apply from the date of the written notification from INZ.
