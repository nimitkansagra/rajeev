<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">When an application for a resident visa is approved in principle, applicants will be given two copies of the Agreement to complete for each person in the application undertaking ESOL tuition. </li><li class="listletter">After completion of the Agreement, one copy is retained by the applicant, and the other copy is returned to the relevant INZ processing office with the tuition fee(s). </li><li class="listletter">If the Agreement is not signed and returned to INZ within the time specified by INZ, the resident visa application must be declined. </li><li class="listletter">The INZ copy of the Agreement should be sent to the TEC.</li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">F4.15.30 Failure to pre-purchase ESOL tuition</p>
<p class="bodytext">Any ESOL tuition fee must be paid before a resident visa may be granted. If the tuition fee is not paid to the INZ within the specified time, the resident visa application must be declined.</p>

<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">If ESOL tuition is purchased, the applicant must complete the tuition within five years from the date of payment. </li><li class="listletter">ESOL tuition will not be available without further payment, nor will refunds be given, to applicants who do not take up ESOL tuition within the time limits specified at F4.15.35(a).</li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">F4.15.40 Refund of ESOL tuition fees</p>
<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">If ESOL tuition fees are paid but the applicant does not take up residence by being a residence class visa holder in New Zealand, a refund of the ESOL tuition fee may be granted upon request to INZ. The request must be made in writing. </li><li class="listletter">Requests for refunds must be declined if they are made more than six months after the expiry of the travel conditions allowing travel to New Zealand. </li><li class="listletter">Immigration officers considering requests for refunds must be satisfied that none of the applicants included in the application have: <ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">entered New Zealand as residents; or </li><li class="listroman">hold resident visas with current travel conditions.</li></ol></li><li class="listletter">The person who paid the ESOL tuition fee will only be refunded the ESOL entitlement.
