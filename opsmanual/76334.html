<p class="bodytext">Marine crew are considered to be required for the operation of the ship if they are working on the ship as crew and are essential for the operation of the ship to travel to New Zealand. This specifically excludes anyone on a ship travelling as a passenger.</p>
<p class="note"><strong class="bold">Example:</strong> a charter yacht normally operates private week long charters in the Pacific islands. The charter normally caters for 10 guests and requires 20 crew members to operate the charter. When no guests are on board and no charters are running, the yacht only requires 6 crew members to operate. For a ship to meet the &#8216;compelling need to travel to New Zealand&#8217; requirement then only the 6 crew members required to safely operate the ship for it to travel to New Zealand will be allowed.</p>
