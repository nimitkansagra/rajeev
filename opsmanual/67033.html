<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">The objective of accreditation is to allow accredited employers to supplement their own New Zealand workforce in their core area of business activity through: <ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">the recruitment of workers who are not New Zealand citizens or residence class visa holders and whose talents are required by the employer; and </li><li class="listroman">the accredited employer having direct responsibility for those employees and their work output.</li></ol></li><li class="listletter">Under Talent (Accredited Employer) Work Instructions, accredited employers may offer employment to workers who are not New Zealand citizens or residence class visa holders without the need to establish that there are no New Zealand citizens or residence class visa holders suitably qualified by training and experience available, or readily able to be trained, to do the work. </li><li class="listletter">Accreditation will be granted where INZ is satisfied that an employer: <ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">is in a sound financial position; and </li><li class="listroman">has human resource policies and processes which are of a high standard; and </li><li class="listroman">has a demonstrable commitment to training and employing New Zealand citizens or residence class visa holders; and </li><li class="listroman">has good workplace practices, including a history of compliance with all immigration and employment laws such as the Immigration Act 2009, the Accident Compensation Act 2001, the Minimum Wage Act 1983, the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, the Employment Relations Act 2000, Wages Protection Act 1983, Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987, the Equal Pay Act 1972 and the Holidays Act 2003.</li></ol></li><li class="listletter">In determining whether employers may be accredited, INZ will assess applications taking into account such factors as: <ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">the period for which the employing organisation has been established as a going concern; </li><li class="listroman">whether the employer has engaged with the relevant Industry Training Organisation (ITO); </li><li class="listroman">whether the employer is a member of the Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) Employers Group; </li><li class="listroman">whether the employer is International Organisation for Standardisation (IOS) certified; </li><li class="listroman">whether the employer has an intention to maintain accreditation throughout the period of currency of any visas granted to their employees under the Talent (Accredited Employers) Work Instructions.</li></ol></li><li class="listletter">Applicants must consent to INZ seeking information from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, WorkSafe New Zealand and the Accident Compensation Corporation concerning the applicant's compliance with New Zealand employment laws. Where such consent is not given an application for accreditation will be declined. </li><li class="listletter">INZ will decline an application for accreditation where the employer has a history of non-compliance with immigration or employment law, including if they fail to meet the requirements set out at W2.10.15 or are currently included on a list of non-compliant employers maintained by the Labour Inspectorate (see Appendix 10).</li><li class="listletter">INZ will decline an application for accreditation where it considers accreditation would create unacceptable risks to the integrity of New Zealand's immigration or employment laws or policies. </li><li class="listletter">Because the accreditation of employers whose main business is the facilitation of entry to New Zealand of non-New Zealand citizens and residence class visa holders under Government immigration instructions potentially creates an unacceptable risk to the integrity of New Zealand's immigration laws and policies, applications for accreditation by such employers will not be approved. </li><li class="listletter">INZ will rescind an employer's accreditation where it considers that an accredited employer's conduct has created an unacceptable risk to the integrity of New Zealand's immigration or employment laws or policies. Decisions to rescind accreditation will not be made by INZ without the consent of the Minister of Immigration. </li><li class="listletter">Approved employers will be granted accreditation for a period of 12 months. </li><li class="listletter">Accreditation may be renewed on an annual basis, upon application, where INZ is satisfied that the employer still meets the requirements for accreditation set out above. </li><li class="listletter">A fee is payable for an application for accreditation. A lower fee is payable for annual renewal of accreditation.</li></ol><p class="headingopsmanual">WR1.25.1 Applying for accreditation</p>

<ol class="listletter"><li class="listletter">INZ must be satisfied that the information and documents included in an application for accreditation are genuine and accurate, and may take any steps it determines necessary to verify such documents and the information they contain, including interviews. </li><li class="listletter">INZ may, where necessary, seek the approval of an employer to conduct a site visit to the employer's premises. </li><li class="listletter">INZ will consult with relevant unions and other employee representatives when determining whether an employer has human resource policies and processes which are of a high standard, a commitment to training and employing New Zealand citizens and residence class visa holders and good workplace practices. </li><li class="listletter">Where any information is: <ol class="listroman"><li class="listroman">identified by the employer as commercially sensitive; and </li><li class="listroman">that information is provided in confidence to INZ; and </li><li class="listroman">INZ considers that disclosure of that information is necessary for the determination of an application;</li></ol><p class="listcontinue">INZ will seek the consent of the employer for the disclosure of that information.
